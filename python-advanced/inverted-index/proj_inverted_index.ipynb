    "document_1 = '3189\\tAscending chain condition The ascending chain condition (ACC) and descending chain condition (DCC) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly, ideals in certain commutative rings.    These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, and Emil Artin. The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any partially ordered set. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler. DefinitionA partially ordered set (poset) P is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition (ACC) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements eventually terminates.  Equivalently, given any sequence  a_1 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_2 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_3 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, \\\\cdots,  there exists a positive integer n such that  a_n = a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} = \\\\cdots.  Similarly, P is said to satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC) if every strictly descending sequence of elements eventually terminates, that is, there is no infinite descending chain. Equivalently every descending sequence  \\\\cdots \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_3 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_2 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_1  of elements of P, eventually stabilizes. Comments A subtly different and stronger condition than \"containing no infinite ascending/descending chains\" is \"contains no arbitrarily long ascending/descending chains (optionally, \\'based at a given element\\')\". For instance, the disjoint union of the posets {0}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, etc., satisfies both the ACC and the DCC, but has arbitrarily long chains. If one further identifies the 0 in all of these sets, then every chain is finite, but there are arbitrarily long chains based at 0. The descending chain condition on P is equivalent to P being well-founded: every nonempty subset of P has a minimal element (also called the minimal condition). Similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to P being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of P has a maximal element (the maximal condition). Every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC. A totally ordered set that satisfies the descending chain condition is called a well-ordered set.

Being the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously until it was relaunched with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. A film named after the comic was released July 3, 2012.After DC Comics\\' relaunch of Action Comics and Detective Comics with new #1 issues in 2011, it had been the highest-numbered American comic still in circulation until it was cancelled. The title ended its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with issue #700 in December 2012. It was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel\\'s comic lines.    Publication history The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Steve Ditko, and the pair produced 38 issues from 1962 to 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel\\'s most identifiable hero.The Amazing Spider-Man has been the character\\'s flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1976 (although 1972 saw the debut of Marvel Team-Up, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters). Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in Amazing, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character\\'s history have occurred. The title was published continuously until #441 (Nov. 1998) when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man\\'s 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, #700 (Dec. 2012). Vol. 1  Vol. 2  Years   1-49       1963-1967   50-99      1967-1971   100-149    1971-1975   150-199    1975-1979   200-249    1980-1984   250-299    1984-1988   300-349    1988-1991   350-399    1991-1995   401-441    1995-1998   (442-499)  1-58  1999-2003    500-549  2003-2008    550-599  2008-2009    600-649  2009-2011    650-700  2011-2012   The 1960sThe initial years of the book, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man\\'s nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for The Daily Bugle (under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson) to help support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while also embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson\\'s secretary, Betty Brant.By focusing on Parker\\'s everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko\\'s quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel\\'s most prominent artist, Jack Kirby, and Ditko\\'s Spider-Man, slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony,  combined with the humor and pathos of Lee\\'s writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.Most of Spider-Man\\'s key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his astronaut son John Jameson, and the supervillain the Chameleon. It also included the hero\\'s first encounter with the superhero team The Fantastic Four. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of The Vulture and the beginning of Parker\\'s freelance photography career at the newspaper The Daily Bugle. The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in #3 (July 1963); the Sandman and Betty Brant in #4 (Sept. 1963); the Lizard in #6 (Nov. 1963); Electro in #9 (March 1964); Mysterio in #13 (June 1964); the Green Goblin in #14 (July 1964); Kraven The Hunter in #15 (Aug. 1964); reporter Ned Leeds in #18 (Nov. 1964); the Scorpion in #20 (Jan. 1965); and the Molten Man in #28 (Sept. 1965) (that also featured Parker\\'s graduation from high school Peter began attending Empire State University in #31 (Dec. 1965), the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn. Harry\\'s father, Norman Osborn first appeared in #23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson\\'s country club but is not named nor revealed as Harry\\'s father until #37 (June 1966). Probably the most celebrated issue of the Lee-Ditko run  is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \"If This Be My Destiny\", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. However, a rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, The Amazing Spider-Man  (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have been a source of controversy  ever since. Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...\" In successor penciler John Romita\\'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita\\'s Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko\\'s – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as Daily Bugle managing editor Robbie Robertson in #52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain George Stacy, father of Parker\\'s girlfriend Gwen Stacy, in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964).Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker\\'s world by improving Parker\\'s relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man\\'s adventures. The stories also became more topical, addressing issues such as civil rights, racism, prisoners\\' rights, the Vietnam War, and political elections.Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the Kingpin, who would become a major force as well in the superhero series Daredevil. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in #41 (Oct. 1966), the Shocker in #46 (March 1967), the Prowler in #78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin\\'s son, Richard Fisk, in #83 (April 1970). The 1970s  Two spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: Marvel Team-Up in 1972, and The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1976. The flagship title\\'s second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain George Stacy. This was also the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by Gil Kane, who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the Comics Code Authority with this story, in which Parker\\'s friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on LSD. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman, Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.  The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.The \"Six-Arm Saga\" of #100-102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced Morbius, the Living Vampire. The second installment was the first Amazing Spider-Man story not written by co-creator Lee, with Roy Thomas taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics\\' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old wunderkind Gerry Conway, who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway\\'s first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster Hammerhead in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June–July 1973), which featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" (#121). Her demise and the Goblin\\'s apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of Mary Jane Watson and her relationship with Parker.By late 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by Ross Andru, whose run lasted nearly 60 issues, from 1973 to 1978. Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the Punisher, who would become one of Marvel Comics\\' most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era also featured the first appearances of the Man-Wolf in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (April 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father\\'s role as the Green Goblin in #135-137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original \"Clone Saga\", containing the introduction of Spider-Man\\'s clone, in #147-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975). Archie Goodwin and Gil Kane produced the title\\'s 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before Len Wein became writer for two-and-a-half years. During Wein\\'s tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison, and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein\\'s last story on Amazing was a five-issue arc in #176-180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton). Marv Wolfman, Marvel\\'s editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson (who refused, in the following issue). Keith Pollard succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade, and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s. The 1980s The Amazing Spider-Man #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the burglar who killed Spider-Man\\'s Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by Dennis O\\'Neil, a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival DC Comics, and penciler John Romita, Jr.. Roger Stern, who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title The Spectacular Spider-Man, took over Amazing in late 1981. During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains, and with Romita Jr. created the mysterious supervillain the Hobgoblin in #238-239 (March–April 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin\\'s secret identity, which continued throughout #244-245 and 249-251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 & Feb.-April 1984). One lasting change was the reintroduction of Mary Jane Watson as a more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter\\'s confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity.By mid-1984, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson\\'s mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters\\' wedding in 1985. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man\\'s black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years\\' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the Rose, in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a symbiote; and the introduction of the female mercenary Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from The Amazing Spider-Man in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.  A succession of artists including Alan Kupperberg, John Romita, Jr., and Alex Saviuk penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part \"Gang War\" story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former Spectacular Spider-Man writer Peter David scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin (although this was retconned in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all).David Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21. Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on The Amazing Spider-Man since Frenz\\'s departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man\\'s look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane\\'s other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man\\'s most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom. Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom\\'s first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue also featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. After the editorial and creative turmoil that beset The Amazing Spider-Man in 1987, the Michelinie/McFarlane team at the tail-end of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book, and set the tone for Spider-Man for the next decade. In July 2012, Todd McFarlane\\'s original cover art for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #328 sold for a bid of $657,250, making it the most expensive American comic book art ever sold at auction.   The 1990sWith a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply Spider-Man. His successor, Erik Larsen, penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue #350, Larsen was succeeded by Mark Bagley, who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on New Warriors in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996, with his art forming the basis for most Spider-Man licensed merchandise of the decade and onward. Issues #361-363 (April–June 1992) introduced Carnage, a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series\\' 30th-anniversary issue, #365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker\\'s parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in #388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie\\'s last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.Issue #375 was released with a gold foil cover. However, there was an error affecting some issues and as a result, a double cover miswrap was released into circulation.With #389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 \"Kraven\\'s Last Hunt\" story arc and a 1991–1993 run on The Spectacular Spider-Man, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, Amazing stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in #400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May — later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The \"Clone Saga\" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,  and was later reversed in the \"Revelations\" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by The Amazing Scarlet Spider #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including Ron Garney, Steve Skroce, Joe Bennett, and Rafael Kayanan, penciled the book until the final issue, #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). Relaunch and the 2000sMarvel began The Amazing Spider-Man anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).    Howard Mackie wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch proved controversial with the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed due to fan backlash.  Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne\\'s controversial  \"Spider-Man: Chapter One\", which launched at the same time as the reboot. Mackie\\'s run ended with The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001, which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.With #30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer. While his arrival saw the title regain lost readers,  Straczynski oversaw additional controversial  storylines — most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man\\'s powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider\\'s bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,  and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in The Amazing Spider-Man #50. Straczynski also gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.Issue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including Fantastic Four, likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. In October 2000, John Romita, Jr. succeeded John Byrne as artist. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003).  Mike Deodato, Jr. penciled the book from mid-2004 until 2006.That year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"Civil War\", in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government\\'s new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"One More Day\", written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through The Amazing Spider-Man #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #24 (Nov. 2007) and The Sensational Spider-Man #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker\\'s dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski\\'s six-and-a-half years as writer (from 2001 to 2007) on the title after 75 issues (including issues of Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and The Sensational Spider-Man as part of crossovers).Following this, Marvel made The Amazing Spider-Man the company\\'s sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"Brand New Day\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in The Spectacular Spider-Man #200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man\\'s secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). The alternating regular writers were initially Dan Slott, Bob Gale, Marc Guggenheim, Fred Van Lente, and Zeb Wells, joined by a rotation of artists that included Chris Bachalo, Phil Jimenez, Mike McKone, John Romita, Jr. and Marcos Martín. Joe Kelly, Mark Waid and Roger Stern later joined the writing team and Barry Kitson the artist roster. 2010s and end of publicationWith issue #648 (January 2011), the series became a twice-monthly title with Dan Slott as sole writer. Eight additional pages were added per issue.

Its paradigmatic  ethnographic example is the division of India\\'s Hindu society into rigid social groups, with roots in India\\'s ancient history and persisting until today.  However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Hindu caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside Hinduism and India.According to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch, caste discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.   EtymologyThe English word \"caste\" derives from the Spanish and Portuguese casta, which the Oxford English Dictionary quotes John Minsheu\\'s Spanish dictionary (1599) to mean, \"race, lineage, or breed.\"     When the Spanish colonized the New World, they used the word to mean a \"clan or lineage.\"   However, it was the Portuguese who employed casta in the primary modern sense when they applied it to the many in-marrying hereditary Hindu social groups  they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498.      The use of the spelling \"caste,\" with this latter meaning, is first attested to in English in 1613.  Caste system of India    Historically, the caste system in India consisted of four well-known categories (the Varnas):  Brahmin (priests) Kshatriyas (warriors) Vaishyas (traders) Shudras (workmen) The fifth one (Refer to next paragraph) Dalits (do all the things that relates with death and other gruesome things) Some people were left out from these four caste classifications, and were called Panchama or Dalits (literally, the fifth). Regarded as outcastes or the untouchables, these were shunned and ostracized. The varnas themselves have been further subdivided into thousands of jatis.    Ancient Indian text on laws, such as Manusmṛti suggest a caste system was part of Indian society. These laws in ancient India discriminated between castes. For example, the laws of Manusmṛti declare sexual relationships between men and women of different castes as illegal.  Upon independence from the British rule, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for affirmative action.  The Scheduled Castes are sometimes called as Dalit in contemporary literature.  In 2001, the proportion of Dalit population was 16.2 percent of India\\'s total population.    Caste in rest of South Asia Nepal  The Nepalese caste system resembles that of the Indian Jāti system with numerous Jāti divisions with a Varna system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Lichchhavi period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–95) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–75). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–36). Pakistan Religious, historical and sociocultural factors have helped define the bounds of endogamy for Muslims in some parts of Pakistan. There is a preference for endogamous marriages based on the clan-oriented nature of the society, which values and actively seeks similarities in social group identity based on several factors, including religious, sectarian, ethnic, and tribal/clan affiliation. Religious affiliation is itself multilayered and includes religious considerations other than being Muslim, such as sectarian identity (e.g. Shia or Sunni, etc.) and religious orientation within the sect (Isnashari, Ismaili, Ahmedi, etc.). Both ethnic affiliation (e.g. Sindhi, Baloch, Punjabi, etc.) and membership of specific biraderis or zaat/quoms are additional integral components of social identity.    Within the bounds of endogamy defined by the above parameters, close consanguineous unions are preferred due to a congruence of key features of group- and individual-level background factors as well as affinities. McKim Marriott claims a social stratification that is hierarchical, closed, endogamous and hereditary is widely prevalent, particularly in western parts of Pakistan. Frederik Barth in his review of this system of social stratification in Pakistan suggested that these are castes.    Sri Lanka  The Caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata,  influenced by the classic Aryan Varnas of North India and the Dravida Jāti system found in South India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka\\'s monarchy. Caste-like stratification outside South Asia South-east Asia MyanmarKaren are people from the Burma-Thailand border region. They were claimed by Christian missionaries and British colonialists as people who were treated by the ethnic majority as low-caste people or dirty-feeders.  Bali  Balinese caste structure has been described in early 20th century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, dwijati (twice born) in contrast to ekajati (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently than the caste categories for India:    Brahmanas - priest Satrias - knighthood Wesias - commerce Sudras - servitude The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five – Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to castas in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.  East Asia Japan  In Japan\\'s history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles (kuge), together with the Shogun and daimyo. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as mibunsei (身分制). These were: samurai, peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only the samurai class was allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants and other craftsmen and merchants whom he felt were disrespectful. Craftsmen produced products, being the third, and the last merchants were thought to be as the meanest class because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, the peasant caste were labelled as furiuri, tanagari, mizunomi-byakusho amongst others. The castes and sub-classes, as in Europe, were from the same race, religion and culture.Howell, in his review of Japanese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan. De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that a systematic and extensive caste system was part of the Japanese society. They also discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often quickly assumed to be slightly different, are superficial terms, two faces of identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and other countries of the world.   Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.  Japan had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term Eta, now called Burakumin. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the Buraku or Burakumin underclasses.  The Burakumin are regarded as \"ostracised.\"      The burakumin are one of the main minority groups in Japan, along with the Ainu of Hokkaidō and those of residents of Korean and Chinese descent. West Asia YemenIn Yemen there exists a hereditary caste, the African-descended Al-Akhdam who are kept as perennial manual workers. A 2008 New York Times report claims that Yemen has over 1 million of these discriminated and ostracized Al-Akhdam people, that is about 5 percent of Yemen population.  Africa Various sociologists have reported caste systems in Africa.      The specifics of the caste systems have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa, however the following features are common - it has been a closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary.  In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the Nupe of Nigeria, the Beni Amer of East Africa, and the Tira of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.  West Africa  Among the Igbo of Nigeria - especially Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states of the country - Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one\\'s birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities. The osu class systems of eastern Nigeria and southern Cameroon are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders. In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in Cote d\\'lvoire, with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers. Similarly, the Mandé societies in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the jonow slaves as inferior. Similarly, the Wolof in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the geer (freeborn/nobles), jaam (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass neeno. In various parts of West Africa, Fulani societies also have class divisions. Other castes include Griots, Forgerons, and Cordonniers.Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the Malinke people no later than 14th century, and was present among the Wolof and Soninke, as well as some Songhay and Fulani populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the Sosso-Malinke war described in the Sunjata epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire. As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.    Central AfricaAlbert in 1960 claimed that the societies in Central Africa were caste-like social stratification systems.  Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in Rwanda and Burundi can be best described as castes.  The Tutsi, noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous Hutu and the least numerous Twa regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.  Maquet\\'s theories have been controversial. East AfricaIn a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Rwanda and Ethiopia in communities such as the Gurage and Konso. He then presents the Dime of South-West Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited. The Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa also have a class system, where the Watta, an acculturated Bantu group, represent the poorest class.The traditionally nomadic Somali people are divided into clans, wherein the Rahanweyn agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the Madhiban are sometimes treated as outcasts.  Europe France and SpainFor centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded Cagots of western France and northern Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the Churches, they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.

It was founded in AD 330, at ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great, after whom it was named. In the 12th century, Rosenberg, Matt. \"Largest cities through history.\" About.com.  the city was the largest and wealthiest European city.  Eventually the empire of Christian Eastern Orthodoxy in the east was reduced to just the capital and its environs, falling to the Ottomans in the historic battle of 1453. The city itself remained and prospered as the Muslim capital in the Ottoman period; however, scholars normally reserve the name \"Constantinople\" for the city in Christian period 330–1453, preferring \"Istanbul\" for the city\\'s name in later centuries. However, many Western writers have continued to refer to the city by its older name \"Constantinople\" into modern times.   The name \"Constantinople\" is still used by members of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox patriarch based in the city, referred to as \"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.\"Constantinople was famed for its massive defenses. Although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, it was taken only in 1204 by the army of the Fourth Crusade, in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, and – finally – in 1453 by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. A first wall was erected by Constantine I, and the city was surrounded by a double wall lying about   to the west of the first wall, begun during the 5th century by Theodosius II. The city was built on seven hills as well as on the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara, and thus presented an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes and towers. It was also famed for architectural masterpieces such as the church of Hagia Sophia, the sacred palace of the emperors, the hippodrome, and the Golden Gate, lining the arcaded avenues and squares. Constantinople contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453.  It was virtually depopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks, Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 28  but the city recovered rapidly, becoming once again by the mid-1600s the world\\'s largest city as the Ottoman capital.  Names The city was originally founded as a Greek colony under the name of Byzantium in the 7th century BC. It took on the name of Konstantinoupolis (\"city of Constantine\", Constantinople) after its re-foundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the imperial capital from its historic base, Rome, to Byzantium in 330 AD and designated his new capital Nova Roma or \"New Rome.\" The modern Turkish name for the city, İstanbul derives from the Greek phrase eis tin polin (εις την πόλιν), meaning \"into the City\" or \"to the City\". This name was used in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. After the creation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turkish government began to formally object to the use of Constantinople in other languages and ask that others use the more common name for the city.      History Byzantium  Constantinople was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I (272–337 AD) on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, probably around 671–662 BC. The site lay astride the land route from Europe to Asia and the seaway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and had in the Golden Horn an excellent and spacious harbour. 306–337 Constantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.Constantinople was built over 6 years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.  Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.  Yet, at first, Constantine\\'s new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a proconsul, rather than an urban prefect. It had no praetors, tribunes, or quaestors. Although it did have senators, they held the title clarus, not clarissimus, like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in Asiana and Pontica and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city. Constantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the Augustaeum. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the Great Palace of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the Chalke, and its ceremonial suite known as the Palace of Daphne. Nearby was the vast Hippodrome for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed Baths of Zeuxippus. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the Milion, a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.From the Augustaeum led a great street, the Mese (Greek: Μέση [Οδός] lit. \"Middle [Street]\"), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the Praetorium or law-court. Then it passed through the oval Forum of Constantine where there was a second Senate-house and a high column with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of Helios, crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there the Mese passed on and through the Forum Tauri and then the Forum Bovis, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the Constantinian Wall. After the construction of the Theodosian Walls in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new Golden Gate, reaching a total length of seven Roman miles.  337–527The first known Prefect of the City of Constantinople was Honoratus, who took office on 11 December 359 and held it until 361. The emperor Valens built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, Turkey), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.The importance of Constantinople gradually increased. After the shock of the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the emperor Valens with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the Visigoths within a few days\\' march, the city looked to its defences, and  in 413–414, Theodosius II built the 18-meter (60-foot)-tall triple-wall fortifications, which were never to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a University near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.Uldin, a prince of the Huns, appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city, and the fleet on the Danube improved.In due course, the barbarians overran the Western Roman Empire: Its emperors retreated to Ravenna, and it diminished to nothing. Thereafter, Constantinople became in truth the largest city of the Roman Empire and of the world. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City, and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople. 527–565 The emperor Justinian I (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in 70 AD and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St. Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church. Chariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.Throughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said  to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the \"Nika\" riots (from the battle-cry of \"Victory!\" of those involved).Fires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine\\'s basilica of St Sophia, the city\\'s principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable St Sophia. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.  The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \"O Solomon, I have outdone thee!\"  St Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build. T. Madden, Crusades: The Illustrated History, 114. Justinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a new church under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of Mehmet II the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city\\'s built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within   of the sea front, in order to protect the view. During Justinian I\\'s reign, the city\\'s population reached about 500,000 people.  However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the Plague of Justinian between 541–542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city\\'s inhabitants.  Survival, 565–717In the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son to the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said at first to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city no longer could be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population dropped substantially in size as a result. While the city withstood a siege, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628,  when the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, further sieges followed in the course of attacks from the Arabs, a first from 674 to 678, and a second from 717 to 718. At this time the Theodosian Walls kept the city impregnable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as \"Greek Fire\" allowed the Byzantine navy to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, decisive help was rendered by the Bulgars. 717–1025 In the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire. Theodora, widow of the Emperor Theophilus (died 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son Michael III, who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the monastery of Gastria, but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867. In 860, an attack was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at Kiev by Askold and Dir, two Varangian chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban Prince\\'s Islands. Oryphas, the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens. In 980, the emperor Basil II received an unusual gift from Prince Vladimir of Kiev: 6,000 Varangian warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the Varangian Guard. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the Thracesian theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.  However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.  Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by Anglo-Saxons who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new Norman kings of England. The Book of the Eparch, which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city\\'s commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.  Iconoclast controversyIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.  Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \"fruit store and aviary\".  Following the death of his son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress Theodora, who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the Western and the Eastern Churches. Prelude to the Comnenian period, 1025–1081In the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire\\'s resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople. 1081–1185 Under the Comnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery. In 1090–91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.  In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account.  John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds. With the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I\\'s reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people. J. Phillips, The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople, 144.  In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews. J. Phillips, The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople, 155. In artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the mosaic art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization): \"With its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the work-shops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals – lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins – confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\" \"From the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark\\'s at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefalù, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the twelfth century. Hispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of Monte Cassino, merchants of Amalfi, and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\" 1185–1261 On 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) on the Golden Horn.     Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders. In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the chain protecting the Golden Horn and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new Alexius IV found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.In February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in St Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.Sir Steven Runciman, historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is “unparalleled in history”. For the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the Latin Empire. The Byzantine nobility were scattered. Many went to Nicaea, where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to Epirus, where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to Trebizond, where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.  Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was captured from its last Latin ruler, Baldwin II, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus. 1261–1453 and the Fall of Constantinopole  Although Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people. T. Madden, Crusades: The Illustrated History, 113.  The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents having fled the city when the Crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital. J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Decline and Fall, 217.  In 1347, the Black Death spread to Constantinople.  In 1453, when the Ottoman Turks captured the city, it contained approximately 50,000 people. D. Nicolle, Constantinople 1453: The end of Byzantium, 32. On 29 May 1453, Turkish sultan Mehmed II \"the Conqueror\" entered Constantinople after a 53–day siege during which his cannon had torn a huge hole in the Walls of Theodosius II. Constantinople (Ottoman Turkish: Konstantiniyye) became the third capital of the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed had begun the siege on 6 April 1453. He had hired engineers to build cannons and bombs for the occasion. He also acquired scholars and imams to encourage the soldiers. He gave the Byzantine emperor Constantine Palaeologus (1449–1453) three chances to surrender the city, a duty enjoined by the Shariah (Muslim Holy Law).  Mehmed guaranteed that the city\\'s residents, including their riches, beliefs and honor, would be safe. However, Constantine did not accept these terms of surrender.  After more than a month of fighting, Mehmed’s advisors were beginning to lose hope. Against their counsel, Mehmed continued to fight. The night before the final assault, he studied the previous attempts to take the city. He was comparing ways that would work and where they would not. On the morning of May 29, 1453 the sultan ordered the call of Azan (call to prayer). Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288–1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig. New York: Howard Fertig Inc., 1924. p. 2  This was not a regular prayer session for religious reasons but rather a scare tactic. When the Byzantine forces saw the entire Ottoman army get on their knees to pray, the Byzantine army was witnessing how united the Ottoman Turks were and this worried them. As Eversley put it: \"Their minds were defeated before their bodies.\"  Once the fighting started, it went on for forty-eight days. The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response, the pope sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. Byzantine attempts to burn the Turkish ships failed. For the defenders, this meant loss of control over the Horn and that they were effectively cut off from reinforcements by sea. Since the Byzantine army was still holding on after that defeat, the sultan thought it was time to set up his secret weapon, a huge mobile tower. This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan’s encouragement, two breeches were made in the wall allowing the Muslims to enter the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed. The city was plundered for three days.  In the end, the population which had not been able to escape was deported to Edirne, Bursa and other Ottoman cities, leaving the city deserted except for the Jews of Balat and the Genoese of Pera. Other than the variations in their stories, the battle occurs in the same manner and neither the Byzantine nor Muslim narratives portrays the opposition in a brutal, negative light.  As expected, however, each narrative portrays its side in a heroic light.  The historical narrative from the Ottoman Turkish point of view depicts Mehmed as a clever, strong conqueror: \"The sultan ordered the setting up of his secret weapon which he had invented himself.\"  By contrast, the narrative from the Byzantine side portrays final emperor Constantine Palaeologus as a valiant leader who gave his life for the cause of Orthodoxy. As quoted from a Byzantine essay: \"[Constantine] charged into the sea of the enemy soldiers, hitting left and right in a final act of defiance.\" Hatzopoulos, Dionysios (date unknown). \"The Fall of Constantinople\", p. 10. Retrieved on 2008-02-10 from    Transition to the Ottoman era 1453–1922 For more complete information on the city during the Ottoman period, see Istanbul Finally, Christian Constantinople, the old thorn in the side of generations of Muslim caliphs, was under Muslim Ottoman control. When Mehmed II finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the Topkapi Gate, he immediately rode his horse to the Hagia Sophia, which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an imam meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: “I testify that there is no god but God. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.”  This act transformed the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.Mehmed’s main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city’s defenses and repopulation. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace. Inalcik, Halil. “The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.” Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229–249. p. 236  Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.  From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called \"Sürgün\" in Turkish ( ).  Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray, Çarşamba, bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.  However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.  This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles writes in the middle of 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to mention any name of the ancient Byzantine churches transformed in mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total. Mamboury (1953), p. 99 The 1453 defeat of the Byzantine Orthodox forces, deportation, and fitful return of the Greek-speaking ethnic community in the city have understandably led to hard feelings between ethnic Greeks and Turks into modern times. Importance CultureConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular, Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, \"As for St Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"It was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city\\'s fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years. International statusThe city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula. Many scholars  argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed. With the emergence of Christianity and the rise of Islam, Constantinople became the last bastion of Christian Europe, standing at the fore of Islamic expansion, and repelling its influence. As the Byzantine Empire was situated in-between the Islamic world and the Christian west, so did Constantinople act as Europe’s first line-of-defence against Arab advances in the 7th and 8th centuries. The city, and the Empire, would ultimately fall to the Ottomans by 1453, but its enduring legacy had provided Europe centuries of resurgence following the collapse of Rome. Architecture  The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark\\'s Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used. ReligionConstantine\\'s foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, a situation that contributed to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam. Popularity Constantinople appears as a city of wondrous majesty, beauty, remoteness, and nostalgia in William Butler Yeats\\' 1928 poem \"Sailing to Byzantium\". Constantinople, as seen under the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II, makes several on-screen appearances in the television miniseries \"Attila\" as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Robert Graves, author of I, Claudius, also wrote Count Belisarius, a historical novel about Belisarius. Graves set much of the novel in the Constantinople of Justinian I. Constantinople provides the setting of much of the action in Umberto Eco\\'s 2000 novel Baudolino. Constantinople\\'s change of name was the theme for a song made famous by The Four Lads and later covered by They Might Be Giants and many others entitled \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\". \"Constantinople\" was also the title of the opening edit of The Residents\\' EP Duck Stab!, released in 1978. Queen (band)\\'s Roger Meddows Taylor included the track \"Interlude in Constantinople\" on Side 2 of his debut album Fun in Space. Constantinople under Justinian is the scene of the book A Flame in Byzantium (ISBN 0312930267) by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, released in 1987. \"Constantinople\" is the title of a song by The Decemberists. Stephen Lawhead\\'s novel Byzantium (1996) is set in 9th-century Constantinople. Folk Metal band Turisas makes multiple references to Constantinople in their song \"Miklagard Overture\", referring to it as \"Konstantinopolis\", \"Tsargrad\", and \"Miklagard\". Constantinople makes an appearance in the MMORPG game Silkroad as a major capital, along with a major Chinese capital. Constantinople makes an appearance in the \"Rome Total War\" expansion \"Barbarian Invasion\" belonging to the Eastern Roman Empire Constantinople also makes an appearance in \"Medieval Total War\".

Although he is best known for discovering the dwarf planet Pluto in 1930, the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the Kuiper belt, Tombaugh also discovered many asteroids; he also called for the serious scientific research of unidentified flying objects. BiographyTombaugh was born in Streator, Illinois.  After his family moved to Burdett, Kansas, Tombaugh\\'s plans for attending college were frustrated when a hailstorm ruined his family\\'s farm crops.    Starting in 1926, he built several telescopes with lenses and mirrors he ground himself.  He sent drawings of Jupiter and Mars, as well as his telescopes to the Lowell Observatory. These resulted in a job offer. Tombaugh was employed at the Lowell Observatory from 1929 to 1945. Following his discovery of Pluto, Tombaugh earned bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in astronomy from the University of Kansas in 1936 and 1938.  During World War II he taught naval personnel navigation at Northern Arizona University.  He worked at White Sands Missile Range in the early 1950s, and taught astronomy at New Mexico State University from 1955 until his retirement in 1973.The asteroid 1604 Tombaugh,  discovered in 1931, is named after him. He discovered hundreds of asteroids, beginning with 2839 Annette in 1929, mostly as a by-product of his search for Pluto and his searches for other celestial objects.  Tombaugh named some of them after his wife, children and grandchildren. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded him the Jackson-Gwilt Medal in 1931.  In August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. \"I told him he was welcome to it,\" Tombaugh later remembered, \"though he\\'s got to go one long, cold trip.\"    The call eventually led to the launch of the New Horizons space probe to Pluto in 2006. DeathTombaugh died on January 17, 1996 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, at the age of 90. Approximately one ounce of his ashes is being carried on the New Horizons space probe. The container includes the inscription: \"Interred herein are remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system\\'s \\'third zone\\'. Adelle and Muron\\'s boy, Patricia\\'s husband, Annette and Alden\\'s father, astronomer, teacher, punster, and friend: Clyde W. Tombaugh (1906–1997)\".      Tombaugh was survived by his widow, Patricia (1912–2012), and their children: daughter Annette and son Alden.  Tombaugh was an active Unitarian-Universalist. Discovery of PlutoWhile a young researcher working for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, Tombaugh was given the job to perform a systematic search for a trans-Neptunian planet (also called Planet X), which had been predicted by Percival Lowell and William Pickering. Tombaugh used the observatory\\'s 13-inch astrograph to take photographs of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used a blink comparator to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month.  The name \"Pluto\" was reportedly suggested by Venetia Burney, then an 11-year-old English school girl, who died in April 2009, having lived to see the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. It won out over numerous other suggestions because it was the name of the Roman god of the underworld, who was able to render himself invisible, and because Percival Lowell\\'s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930. Following the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 AU, but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least one such body was larger than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized \"dwarf planets\" rather than with the eight \"classical planets\". Tombaugh\\'s widow Patricia stated after the IAU\\'s decision that while Clyde may have been disappointed with the change since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto\\'s planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he \"was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place.\"  Further searchTombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, and the lack of further discoveries left him satisfied that no other object of a comparable apparent magnitude existed near the ecliptic. No more trans-Neptunian objects were discovered until  , in 1992.However, more recently the relatively bright object   has been discovered. It has a relatively high orbital inclination, but at the time of Tombaugh\\'s discovery of Pluto, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic near the border of Taurus and Auriga  at an apparent magnitude of 16.    This position was also very near the galactic equator, making it almost impossible to find such an object within the dense concentration of background stars of the Milky Way. Asteroids discovered Tombaugh discovered nearly 800 asteroids    during his search for Pluto and years of follow-up searches looking for another candidate for the postulated Planet X. Tombaugh is also credited with the discovery of periodic comet 274P/Tombaugh–Tenagra.    He also discovered hundreds of variable stars, as well as star clusters, galaxy clusters, and a galaxy supercluster.

On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several unidentified objects near Las Cruces, New Mexico. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: \"I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment.\"   Tombaugh observed these rectangles of light for about 3 seconds and his wife saw them for about 1½ seconds.  He never supported the interpretation as a spaceship that has often been attributed to him.  He considered other possibilities, with a temperature inversion as the most likely cause.  From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on other planets, not even for Mars... The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering.  In consideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic time scale when such visits may have possibly occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.   A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in reflective index, as in an inversion layer.   I have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the night sky could be seen well.  This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation. Another sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of −6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh\\'s first sighting. Tombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious green fireballs, which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. Despite this, the final report of Project Twinkle claimed that he \"... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky.\" In 1956 Tombaugh had the following to say about his various sightings: \"I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs... I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of extraterrestrial origin and nature.\"  Shortly after this in January 1957, in an Associated Press article in the Alamogordo Daily News titled \"Celestial Visitors May Be Invading Earth\\'s Atmosphere,\" Tombaugh was again quoted on his sightings and opinion about them. \"Although our own solar system is believed to support no other life than on Earth, other stars in the galaxy may have hundreds of thousands of habitable worlds. Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars...\" Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but has seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. \"These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed. Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence.\" In 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at White Sands Missile Range, Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars on August 27, 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.  Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars.In June 1952, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force\\'s Project Blue Book UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force\\'s disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted.  Near-Earth satellite searchTombaugh\\'s offer may have led to his involvement in a search for near-Earth satellites, first announced in late 1953 and sponsored by the Army Office of Ordnance Research. Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954 (photo at right), emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural space station.  However, according to Donald Keyhoe, later director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his Pentagon source.By May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.  However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when Aviation Week magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed \"natural satellites\" and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the green fireballs and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. LaPaz vehemently denied his involvement in the search, although the New York Times reported on August 29 that a source close to the project said that the story was true and LaPaz was indeed involved, in fact had been the one to spot and identify the objects as natural rather than artificial satellites. The same source denied the search had anything to do with flying saucers. However, both LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine reported: \"Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won\\'t say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered.  He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.\" At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for \"natural satellites\" had been unsuccessful.  In 1959, Tombaugh was to issue a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. His personal 16-inch telescope was reassembled and dedicated on September 17, 2009 at Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico (near Animas, New Mexico), adjacent to Astronomy \\'s new observatory.

The Mosquito was one of the few operational, front-line aircraft of the World War II era to be constructed almost entirely of wood and, as such, was nicknamed \"The Wooden Wonder\".  In his book \"First and Last\" (page 153) Adolf Galland was very impressed by the Mosquito: amongst other things, he claimed that the Mosquito left a very faint signal on the German radar in use at the time because of its wooden construction. This trait has not been mentioned in books or other publications on the Mosquito. The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the \"Mossie\" to its crews  Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to many other roles during the air war, including: low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a transport. When the Mosquito entered production in 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world. Bowman 2005, p. 21.  Entering widespread service in 1942, the Mosquito first operated as a high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft, and continued to operate in this role throughout the war. From mid-1942 to mid-1943 Mosquito bombers were used in high-speed, medium- or low-altitude missions, attacking factories, railways and other pinpoint targets within Germany and German-occupied Europe. From late 1943, Mosquito bomber units were formed into the Light Night Strike Force and used as pathfinders for RAF Bomber Command\\'s heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as \"nuisance\" bombers, often dropping 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookies\", in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.As a night fighter, from mid-1942, the Mosquito was used to intercept Luftwaffe raids on the United Kingdom, most notably defeating the German aerial offensive, Operation Steinbock, in 1944. Offensively, starting in July 1942, some Mosquito night-fighter units conducted intruder raids over Luftwaffe airfields and, as part of 100 Group, the Mosquito was used as a night fighter and intruder in support of RAF Bomber Command\\'s heavy bombers, and played an important role in reducing bomber losses during 1944 and 1945. Hastings 1979, p. 240.  As a fighter-bomber in the Second Tactical Air Force, the Mosquito took part in \"special raids\", such as the attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944, and in other precision attacks against Gestapo or German intelligence and security forces. 2 TAF Mosquitos also played an important role operating in tactical support of the British Army during the 1944 Normandy Campaign. From 1943 Mosquitos were used by RAF Coastal Command strike squadrons, attacking Kriegsmarine U-boats (particularly in the 1943 Bay of Biscay offensive, where significant numbers of U-boats were sunk or damaged) and intercepting transport ship concentrations.The Mosquito saw service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and many other air forces in the European theatre, and the Mediterranean and Italian theatres. The Mosquito was also used by the RAF in the South East Asian theatre, and by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War.   Development By the early-mid-1930s, de Havilland established a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer, while the later DH.91 Albatross airliner successfully pioneered the composite wood construction that the Mosquito would use. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at   at  , a vast improvement on the   Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing.  The wooden monocoque construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time. Bowman 2005, p. 9.  Air Ministry bomber requirements and conceptsOn 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.13/36, which called for a twin-engined medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of   for   with a maximum speed of   at  ; a maximum bomb load of   which could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.   Major aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the Avro Manchester and Handley Page Halifax. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31. In May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, George Volkert, who was the chief designer of Handley Page, put forward to the Air Ministry the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In his 20-page document, Volkert laid out plans for an aerodynamically clean medium bomber that would carry   of bombs at a cruising speed of  . There was some support for the idea in the RAF and Air Ministry; for example a Captain Liptrot, who was then Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert\\'s design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the brand new Supermarine Spitfire. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily maintain a speed advantage over enemy fighters for long.  The Ministry was also considering the use of non-strategic materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, led to specification B.9/38 and the development of the Albemarle medium bomber, which was largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. Thus it can be seen that the idea of a small, fast bomber, possibly made out of non-strategic materials, was already gaining support at a much earlier stage than is sometimes acknowledged.  Inception of the de Havilland fast bomber Another designer who believed that meeting the P.13/36 specification would lead to a mediocre aircraft was Geoffrey de Havilland, who felt that an aerodynamically clean design, with minimal skin area, was a good concept for a bomber. He initially thought that adapting the Albatross airliner to meet the RAF\\'s requirements was a time-saving possibility. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced of a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules and Napier Sabre as alternatives.  On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland sent a letter to Air Marshal Wilfred Freeman, the Air Council\\'s member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in the event of war, there would be shortages of materials such as duralumin or steel, while there should be plentiful supplies of wood. Additionally, although inferior torsionally, the strength to weight ratio of wood was as good as that of duralumin or steel, and, given such considerations, a different approach to designing a high-speed bomber was possible. After further consideration, in a follow-up letter sent to Freeman on 27 July, de Havilland stated that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin powered aircraft and that either the top speed or load carrying capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of   carrying a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,800\\xa0kg) bomb load, with a maximum speed of   at  , and a cruising speed of   at  . De Havilland believed that such a concept was too much of a compromise, and that getting rid of some surplus equipment would lead to a better design.  On 4 October 1938, for example, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the D.H 91 Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and armed with six or eight forward firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of   it would have a top speed of   and cruising speed of   at  . Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p.31. Still believing that this performance could be improved upon, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a completely new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, of wooden construction and powered by the Merlin, which offered promise of substantial future development.  The new design would be faster than all current or foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would only slow it down and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier for the design to evade both fighters and ground fire.  Also, the lack of turrets meant that production would be simplified and production time reduced, with a delivery rate far in advance of any competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and a navigator. This was in contrast to contemporary RAF design philosophy, which required well-armed heavy bombers and was much more akin to the German schnellbomber concept. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.  During a meeting held in early October 1938 between Geoffrey de Havilland, Charles C Walker (de Havilland\\'s chief engineer) and Air Ministry officials, the latter showed little interest in de Havilland\\'s concept and, instead, asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6. By September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for both single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, while speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs. Buttler 2004, p. 78.  One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single    Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of   and capable of carrying a 1,000\\xa0lb (450\\xa0kg) bomb load  . On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote \"...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.\"  By 4 October work had progressed to a twin engine light bomber with a wingspan of  , and powered by either Merlin or Griffon engines, with the Merlin being favoured because of its immediate availability. On 5 October 1939, with the Second World War a month old, the nucleus of a design team under the leadership of Eric Bishop, de Havilland\\'s chief designer, moved to the security and secrecy of Salisbury Hall and started work on what was now known as the DH.98. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34. Bishop had worked on the DH.88 Comet and the Albatross under de Havilland\\'s then chief designer A. E. Hagg.  With an eye to making the DH.98 more versatile, Bishop made provision for four 20\\xa0mm cannon which could be installed in the forward half of the bomb bay, immediately under the cockpit, and firing via blast tubes and troughs under the forward fuselage. Bowman 2005, p. 11. The DH.98 was still too radical for the Air Ministry, which continued to want a heavily armed, multi-role aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and \"general purpose\" roles, as well as being capable of maritime strike, for which torpedo carrying equipment was specified.   With the outbreak of the war, the Air Ministry became more receptive, but were still sceptical about sanctioning an unarmed bomber and thought that the Germans would produce fighters which were faster than expected.  Instead, the Ministry asked de Havilland to compromise and suggested two forward and two rear firing machine guns for defence. Bowman 2005, p. 10.  The Air Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at the very least a third crewman to reduce the workload of the others on long flights.  The Air Council then added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of   at   on two-thirds engine power, and a range of   with a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,800\\xa0kg) bomb load.  To appease the Air Ministry, de Havilland built several mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit, but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes to the fundamentals of the design. On 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, Blackburn, and Bristol, Marshal W. Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the Rolls-Royce Griffon and the Napier Sabre. Although estimates for a slightly larger Griffon powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, were presented, Freeman was able to get the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of   at  . One month later, on 12 December 1939, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command met to finalise the details of the design and decide how it was to fit within the RAF\\'s strategic aims. The AOC-in-C still would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted it would be suitable for reconnaissance missions with either F8 or F24 cameras. Bowman 2005, p. 12.  After representatives of the company, the Air Ministry and the RAF\\'s operational commands had examined a full scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project finally received official backing. Buttler 2004, p. 80.   This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Air Marshal Freeman chaired another meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly, who was Buchanan\\'s chief of staff. Claiming the DH.98 was the \"fastest bomber in the world\", de Havilland added \"it must be useful\". Freeman supported its production for RAF service and ordered a single prototype for an unarmed bomber variant to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two   Rolls-Royce RM3SM (experimental designation for what became known as the Merlin 21) with ducted radiators, capable of carrying a 1,000\\xa0lb (450\\xa0kg) bomb load.    The aircraft was to have a speed of   at   and a cruising speed of   at   with a range of   at   on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be  . On 1 March 1940, Air Marshal Roderic Hill issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the factory serial E0234.   In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland were authorised to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after some debate, that this prototype, given the serial number W4052, would carry Airborne Interception (AI) Mk.IV  equipment as a day and night fighter.The term Radar, which originated in the USA, was not used by the British until later in the war. By June 1940, the DH.98 had been given the name \"Mosquito\". Buttler 2004, p. 80.  Having the fighter variant helped keep the Mosquito project alive because there was still plenty of criticism over the usefulness of an unarmed bomber within the government and Air Ministry, even after the first prototype had flown and shown its capabilities.  Project Mosquito Once the design of the DH.98 had started, de Havilland built several mock-ups, the most detailed of which was at Salisbury Hall, in the hangar where E0234 was being built. Initially, this mock-up was designed with the crew completely enclosed in the fuselage behind a completely transparent nose (similar to that of the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a more conventional canopy. The construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the Battle of Dunkirk, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1941. Although Lord Beaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project had better stop, he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.  In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production was to focus on five existing types, namely the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley and the Bristol Blenheim.  Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped, and it seemed that the project would be shut down when the design team were denied the materials with which to build their prototype. Jackson 2003, p. 7. The Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland\\'s General Manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by December 1941, and this, only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland\\'s primary work of producing Tiger Moth and Oxford trainers and repairing Hurricanes as well as the licence manufacture of Merlin engines.  In promising Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that 50 Mosquitos could be built in such a limited time; as it transpired only 20 Mosquitos were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942. During the Battle of Britain, nearly a third of de Havilland\\'s factory time was lost because the workers took cover in the factory\\'s bomb shelters.  Nevertheless, work on the prototype went quickly, such that E0234 was rolled out on 19 November 1940. In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were eventually built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The latter, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.  This caused some delays as half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the expected higher combat load requirements. The nose sections also had to be altered, omitting the clear perspex bomb-aimer\\'s position, to solid noses designed to house four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.  Prototypes and test flightsOn 3 November 1940, the aircraft, still coded E0234, was transported by road to Hatfield, and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building, where successful engine runs were made on 19 November. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers.  E0234 had a wingspan of   and was the only Mosquito to be built with Handley Page slats on the outer leading edges of the wings. Test flights showed that these were not needed and they were disconnected and faired over with doped fabric (these slats can still be seen on W4050).  On 24 November 1940, taxiing trials were carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr., who was the company\\'s chief test pilot and responsible for maiden flights. The tests were successful and the prototype was subsequently readied for flight testing, making its first flight piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland, on 25 November. The flight was made 11 months after the start of detailed design work, a remarkable achievement considering the conditions of the time. For this maiden flight, E0234, weighing 14,150\\xa0lbs (6,420\\xa0kg), took off from a   field beside the shed it was built in. John E. Walker, Chief Engine Installation designer, accompanied de Havilland. The takeoff was \"straight forward and easy\" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was obtained. Thirsk 2006, p. 25.  The aircraft reached  , with the only problem being the undercarriage doors - which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs - that remained open by some   at that speed.  This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of E0234 also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment was carried out before further flights. Bowman 2005, p. 18.  On 5 December 1940, the prototype experienced tail buffeting at speeds between   and  . The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to the suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from rear section of the inner engine nacelles was disturbed, leading to a localised stall and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing the buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from striking the tailplane with such force, the company experimented with non-retractable slots, fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane.  These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced by the pilot but failed to cure the tailplane buffeting.  In February 1941, the buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some   behind the wing\\'s trailing edge: this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections. Bowman 2005, p. 19.  On W4050 the nacelle extensions were not as long as those fitted to production Mosquitoes: nacelles of the definitive shape and length were first fitted to the fighter prototype W4052. The extended nacelles and fillets were not fitted to the first nine PR Mk Is, some of which were converted to B Mk IV series 1 bombers. By January 1941, the prototype was carrying the military serial number W4050.   With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew W4050 on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it would be a perfect replacement for the Bristol Beaufighter. During its trials on 16 January 1941, W4050 outpaced a Spitfire at  . The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the Spitfire Mk II, but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being   faster. Over the next few months, W4050 surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at RAF Boscombe Down in February 1941, reaching a top speed of   at   altitude, compared to a top speed of   at   for the Spitfire.  On 19 February, official trials began at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE)  based at Boscombe Down, although de Havilland\\'s representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests. Sharp and Bowyer 1971 pp. 44-45.  On 24 February, as W4050 taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing: this was replaced by the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype W4051 in early March.This accident occurred because the tailwheel unit was unable to caster properly, a problem which was solved in June–July 1941 by the fitting of a Dowty unit. In spite of this setback, the Initial Handling Report 767 issued by the A&AEE stated \"The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... Aileron control light and effective ...\" The maximum speed reached was   at  , with an estimated maximum ceiling of   and a maximum rate of climb of   at  . W4050 continued to be used for long and varied testing programs, being essentially the experimental \"workhorse\" for the Mosquito family.  In late October 1941, it was taken back to the factory to be fitted with Merlin 61s, the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942.  W4050 recorded a maximum speed of   at   (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snowguards, engines in F.S gear) and   at   without snowguards. Thirsk 2006, p. 34. Snowguards were small, oval grids of steel mesh which were fitted in front of the opening of the carburettor air intakes. They were designed to stop ice forming in the mouth of the intake when the aircraft was operating during cold weather, or flying in the cold temperatures encountered at high altitude.In October 1942, in connection with development work on the NF Mk XV, W4050 was fitted with extended wingtips increasing the span to  , first flying in this configuration on 8 December.  Finally, fitted with high-altitude rated two-stage, two-speed Merlin 77s, it reached   in December 1943.  Soon after these flights,W4050 was grounded and was scheduled to be scrapped, but instead continued to serve as an instructional airframe at Hatfield. In September 1958, W4050 was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar in which it had been built, was restored to its original configuration and is now one of the primary exhibits of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.   W4051, which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in W4050 meant that W4051\\'s fuselage was used as a replacement; W4051 was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the    \"No. 1\"  tailplane used by W4050, but had production standard   wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally. Thirsk 2006, p. 269. Construction of the fighter prototype, W4052 was also carried out at the secret Salisbury Hall facility. The new prototype differed from its bomber brethren in a number of ways. It was powered by   Merlin 21s and had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen. Four 20\\xa0mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk II cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay. The bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes. Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.  The solid nose mounted four .303 in (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns and their ammunition boxes which were accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.  In accordance with its role as a day/night fighter prototype W4052 was equipped with AI Mk.IV equipment, complete with an \"arrowhead\"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a \"Special Night\" finish. The RDM2a finish was notoriously rough and it was hard to maintain: tests later proved that it could cut the top speed of a Mosquito by up to   and, by March 1942 was replaced by the black \"Night Type S\" (Night Type Smooth) finish.  It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles. W4052 was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, barrage balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems which enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab. The prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.  W4055 flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941. During flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. W4050 was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. W4052 had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January - August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.   Early on in the Mosquito\\'s operational life, the cooling intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated after a while. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by   per hour.  Production plans and American interestThe Air Ministry had authorised mass production plans to be drawn up on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world\\'s fastest operational aircraft.  The Air Ministry ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, the Air Ministry confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.    By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by de Havilland Canada. Bowman 2005, p. 24. On 20 April 1941, W4050 was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote \"I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.\"  The trials set up future production plans between Britain, Australia and Canada. The Americans did not pursue their interest. It was thought the Lockheed P-38 Lightning could handle the same duties just as easily. Arnold felt the design was being overlooked, and urged the strategic personalities in the United States Army Air Forces to learn from the design if they chose not to adopt it. Several days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF then requested one airframe to evaluate on 12 December 1941, signifying that the USAAF realised that they had entered the war without a fast dual-purpose reconnaissance aircraft. Bowman 2005, p. 20.  Design OverviewThe Mosquito was a fast, twin-engined aircraft with shoulder-mounted wings.  The most produced variant, designated the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers.  The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20\\xa0mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to   of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.  ConstructionThe oval-section fuselage was a frameless monocoque shell built in two halves being formed to shape by band clamps over a mahogany or concrete mould, each holding one half of the fuselage, split vertically. The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean balsawood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian birch, but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only 7/16 in (11.11mm). This sandwich skin was so stiff no internal reinforcement was necessary from the wing\\'s rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead.  The join was along the vertical centre line. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7.  This split construction greatly aided the assembly of the internal equipment as it allowed the technicians easy access to the fuselage interior. Bowman 2005, p. 15.  While the glue in the plywood skin dried, carpenters cut a sawtooth joint into the edges of the fuselage shells, while other workers installed the controls and cabling on the inside wall. When the glue completely dried, the two halves were glued and screwed together. The fuselage was strengthened internally by seven bulkheads made up of two plywood skins parted by spruce blocks, which formed the basis on each half for the outer shell.  Each bulkhead was a repeat of the spruce design for the fuselage halves; a balsa sheet sandwich between two plywood sheets/skins. Bulkhead number seven carried the fittings and loads for the tailplane and rudder, The type of glue originally used was Casein resin, which was later replaced by \"Aerolite\", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde, which was more durable. Aerolite was developed by Dr. Norman de Bruyne at Aero Research Limited (ARL)   The de Havilland company also pioneered the use of radio frequency (RF) heating to accelerate curing of the adhesive.  Many other types of screws and flanges (made of various woods) also held the structure together. The fuselage construction joints were made from balsa wood and plywood strips with the spruce multi-ply being connected by a balsa V joint, along with the interior frame. The spruce would be reinforced by plywood strips at the point where the two halves joined to form the V-joint. Located on top of the joint the plywood formed the outer skin.  During the joining of the two halves (\"boxing up\"), two laminated wooden clamps would be used in the after portion of the fuselage to act as support.  Jackson 2003, p. 8.  A covering of doped Madapolam (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and a coat of silver dope was applied, after which the exterior camouflage was applied.  The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, which was braced during construction, to allow it to be lowered onto the wing centre-section. Once the wing was secured the lower panels were replaced, and the bomb bay or armament doors fitted. The all-wood wing was built as a one-piece structure and was not divided into separate construction sections. It was made up of two main spars, spruce and plywood compression ribs, stringers, and a plywood covering. The outer plywood skin was covered and doped like the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points.  The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag.  The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater. Jackson 2003, p. 87.  The wing contained metal framed and skinned ailerons, but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts.  Jackson 2003, p. 9.  Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction.  The outer leading wing edge had to be brought   further forward to accommodate this design.  The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator were aluminium framed and fabric covered.   The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only  . \"History of the de Havilland Mosquito.\" RAAF Museum Point Cook, 2007. Retrieved 13 August 2009. In November 1944, several crashes occurred in the Far East. At first, it was thought these were as a result of wing structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to \"lift\" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that \"the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season\". However a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford which found faults in six different Marks of Mosquito (all built at De Havilland`s Hatfield and Leavesden plants) which showed similar defects, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack; thus it was concluded that there were construction defects found at the two plants. It was found that the \"Standard of glueing...left much to be desired”. Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.   Records at the time showed that accidents caused by \"loss of control\" were three times more frequent on  Mosquitoes that on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major De Havilland`s initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused \"largely by climate\"    To solve the problem, a sheet of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint along the main spar.  SystemsThe fuel systems allowed the Mosquito to have a good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained   of fuel. Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes).  These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing  , located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin   fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit. Bowman 2005, p. 22.  Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the \"main tanks\" and the total internal fuel load of   was initially deemed appropriate for the type.  In addition, the FB Mk VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to  .  Drop tanks of   or   could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to   . In order to reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes at which the photographic reconnaissance variants flew, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot\\'s seat controlled the pressure valve; as the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.  The engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a   oil tank, including a   air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures. Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes). Electrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine which supplied AC power for radios.  The radio shutters, superchargers, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery.  The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P devices.  The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers. Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes).  The design of the Mark VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific for depth charges for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a   drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells.  The FB.VI had a wingspan of  , a length (over guns) of  . It had a maximum speed of   at  . Maximum take-off weight was   and the range of the aircraft was   with a service ceiling of  .  The main landing gear were housed in the nacelles behind the engines. These were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. Bishop 1995, Appendix 1  The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was retractable. Flight characteristicsThe design was noted for having light and effective control surfaces which allowed for good manoeuvrability. It was noted that the rudder should not be used aggressively at high speeds and the poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.  For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to   and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable   for low speed flying.  For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was   at   weight. The Mosquito had a low stall speed of   with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stall speed decreased to  . Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was  . Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur   before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy. Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).  Operational history   The de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles during the Second World War, being tasked to perform medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attack and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive, until the end of the war.  The Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September. The Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats. Mosquitos were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force, as well as flying \"nuisance raids\" in which Mosquitos often dropped 4,000\\xa0lb \"Cookies\". Despite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito ended the war with the lowest losses of any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command service. Post war, the RAF found that when finally applied to bombing, in terms of useful damage done, the Mosquito had proved 4.95 times cheaper than the Lancaster.  In April 1943, in response to \"political humiliation\" caused by the Mosquito,  Hermann Göring ordered the formation of special Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Major Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were \"little more than glorified squadrons\", were not very successful  against the elusive RAF aircraft. Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79.  Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew the Mosquito. Bob Braham claimed around a third of his 29 kills in a Mosquito, flying mostly daytime operations, while on night fighters Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos.One Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of Versuchsverband OKLs, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.  Göring\\'s commentsThe Mosquito famously annoyed Luftwaffe Commander in Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring when on 20 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis\\' seizure of power, a Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station, putting his speech off air. Göring complained about the high speed of the aircraft and its wooden structure, built by a nation he considered to have large metal reserves, while Germany had shortages of such materials and could not produce such a design.   VariantsUntil the end of 1942 the RAF always used Roman numerals (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943-1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively. PrototypesThree prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was W4050 on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter W4052 on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype W4051 on 10 June 1941. W4051 later flew operationally with  1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU). Photo-reconnaissanceTen Mosquito PR Mk Is were built, four of them \"long range\" versions equipped with a   overload fuel tank in the fuselage.  The contract called for ten of the PR Mk I airframes to be converted to B Mk IV Series 1s.   All of the PR Mk Is, and the B Mk IV Series 1s, had the original short engine nacelles and short span (19\\xa0ft 5.5 in) tailplanes. Their engine cowlings incorporated the original pattern of integrated exhaust manifolds which, after a relatively brief flight time, had a troublesome habit of burning and blistering the cowling panels.  The first operational sortie by a Mosquito was made by a PR Mk I, W4055, on 17 September 1941; during this sortie the unarmed Mosquito PR.I evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at  . Bowman 2005, p. 27.  Powered by two Merlin 21s, the PR Mk I had a maximum speed of  , a cruise speed of  , a ceiling of  , a range of  , and a climb rate of   per minute. Over 30 Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were converted into the PR Mk IV photo-reconnaissance aircraft.  The first operational flight by a PR Mk IV was made by DK284 in April 1942. Bowman 2005, p. 164. The Mosquito PR Mk VIII, built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using 1,565\\xa0hp (1,167\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s. The first PR Mk VIII, DK324 first flew on 20 October 1942. Thirsk 2006, p. 272.  The PR Mk VIII had a maximum speed of 436\\xa0mph (700\\xa0km/h), a cruise speed of 258\\xa0mph (415\\xa0km/h), a ceiling of 38,000\\xa0ft (11,580 m), a range of 2,550\\xa0nm (4,100\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,500\\xa0ft per minute (760 m). Bowman 2005, p. 25. The Mosquito PR Mk IX, 90 of which were built, was the first Mosquito variant  with two-stage, two-speed engines to be produced in quantity; the first of these, LR405, first flew in April 1943.  The PR Mk IX was based on the Mosquito B Mk IX bomber and was powered by two 1,680\\xa0hp (1,253\\xa0kW) Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 engines. It could carry either two  , two   or two   droppable fuel tanks. The Mosquito PR Mk XVI had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling   in the bomb bay, and could also carry two   or   drop tanks.  A total of 435 of the PR Mk XVI were built.  The PR Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 415\\xa0mph (668\\xa0km/h), a cruise speed of 250\\xa0mph (402\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 38,500\\xa0ft (11,730 m), a range of 2,450\\xa0nm (3,942\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m). The Mosquito PR Mk 32 was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged 1,960\\xa0hp (1,260\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs. Bowman 2005, p. 165. The Mosquito PR Mk 34 and PR Mk 34A was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons which was the equivalent of  . A further two 200 gallon (910 litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of 3,600 miles (5,800\\xa0km) cruising at 300\\xa0mph (480\\xa0km/h). Powered by two 1,690\\xa0hp (1,259\\xa0kW) Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by Percival Aircraft Company at Luton.  The PR.34\\'s maximum speed (TAS) was   at sea level,   at   and   at  . \"The latest Mosquitoes.\" Flight, 28 February 1946 via flightglobal.com. Retrieved 17 August 2010.  All PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering 1,710\\xa0hp (1,274\\xa0kW). Bowman 2005, p. 166. Colonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote: \"I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war\". Stanley 2010, p. 35.  Bombers On 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitoes, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the B Mk IV Series 1. W4052 was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941. Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23. The bomber prototype led to the B Mk IV, of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes. Jackson 2003, p. 15.  Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having a larger bomb bay to increase the payload to four   bombs, instead of the four 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by shortening the tail of the 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bomb so that these four larger weapons could be carried (or a 2,000\\xa0lb (920;kg) total load).  The B Mk IV entered service in May 1942 with 105 Squadron. In April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk IV to carry a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg), thin-cased high explosive bomb (nicknamed \"Cookie\"). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward, and 54 B.IVs were subsequently modified and distributed to squadrons of RAF Bomber Command\\'s Light Night Striking Force.   27 B Mk IVs were later converted for special operations with the Highball anti-shipping weapon, and were used by 618 Squadron, formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon.  A B Mk IV, DK290 was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by DZ471,530 and 533.  The B Mk IV had a maximum speed of 380\\xa0mph (611\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 265\\xa0mph (426\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 34,000\\xa0ft (10,360 m), a range of 2,040\\xa0nm (3,280\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,500\\xa0ft per minute (762 m). Other bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered B Mk V high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with W4057 which had the wings strengthened and an addition of two fuel tanks, or alternatively two 500\\xa0lb (227\\xa0kg) bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only W4057 was built in prototype form. Jackson 2003, p. 16.  The Merlin 31 powered B Mk VII was built by de Havilland Canada. It was based on the B.V and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada and only 25 were built. Six were handed over to the United States Army Air Forces.B Mk IX (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype DK 324 was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943. Jackson 2003, p. 17.  In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk IVs and all B Mk IXs then in service would be converted to carry the 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookie\", and all B Mk IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 306  The B Mk IX had a maximum speed of 408\\xa0mph (656\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 250\\xa0mph (402\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 36,000\\xa0ft (10,970 m), a range of 2,450\\xa0nm (3,940\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (869 m). The IX could carry a maximum load of 2-4,000\\xa0lb (910-1,810\\xa0kg) of bombs.  A Mosquito B Mk IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. LR503, known as \"F for Freddie\" (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with No. 109 and subsequently, No. 105 RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after Victory in Europe Day, killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar. The B Mk XVI was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookie\".  The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. DZ540 first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the B Mk XX, was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B.35 was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance).  The B Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 408\\xa0mph (656\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 245\\xa0mph (394\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 37,000\\xa0ft (11,280 m), a range of 1,485\\xa0nm (2,390\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,800\\xa0ft per minute (853 m). The type could carry 4,000\\xa0lb (1,810\\xa0kg) of bombs.  The B.35 had a maximum speed of 422\\xa0mph (679\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 276\\xa0mph (444\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 42,000\\xa0ft (12,800 m), a range of 1,750\\xa0nm (2,820\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,700\\xa0ft per minute (823 m). Bowman 2005, p. 26.  FightersDeveloped during 1940, the  first prototype of the Mosquito F Mk II  was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitos were fitted with four 20\\xa0mm (.79\\xa0in) Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four .303\\xa0in (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs.  The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs. In August 1942 Britain experienced several incursions of high-altitude Luftwaffe bombers, including the Junkers Ju-86P. As a result of these raids, starting in September 1942, five Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were quickly converted into F Mk XV high-altitude, pressurised fighters, powered by two-stage Merlin 73s and 77s fitted with four-bladed propellers. The first of these conversions was MP469, which was wheeled into the experimental shop on 7 September and first flew on 14 September. The bomber nose forward of the cockpit was cut off and a standard fighter nose, complete with four .303 Brownings, grafted on in its place. The pressurised crew cabin retained the bomber\\'s canopy structure, with a vee-shaped, two-piece windscreen, while the bomber\\'s control wheel was replaced by the fighter\\'s control stick. Extended, pointed, wingtips increased the wingspan to  . The airframe was lightened by removing all armour plating, bullet-proofing from the fuel and oil tanks, and the outer wing and fuselage tanks (leaving the inner wing tanks with a total capacity of  ). Other ancillary equipment was also removed, and smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of   the Mk XV was   lighter than a standard Mk II, and reached an altitude of  . Four more B Mk IVs were converted into F Mk XVs, and, in late 1942, were further modified to become NF MK XVs. All fighters and fighter bombers, apart from the F Mk XV, featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece armoured windscreen, and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.   The pilot was provided with a fighter-style control stick rather than a wheel. Night fighters At the end of 1940, the Air Staff\\'s preferred night fighter design was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company\\'s design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito considered for the night fighter requirement instead.  The first production night fighter Mosquitos were designated NF Mk II. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings.  A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942.  23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy. Ninety-seven NF Mk IIs were upgraded with centimetric AI Mk VIII radar and these were designated NF Mk XII. The NF Mk XIII, of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk XII conversions. The centimetric radar sets were mounted in a solid \"thimble\" (Mk XII / XIII) or universal \"bull nose\" (Mk XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with. Four F Mk XVs were converted to the NF Mk XV. These were fitted with AI Mk VIII in a \"thimble\" radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.  NF Mk XVII was the designation for 99 NF Mk II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.The NF Mk XIX was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.The NF Mk 30 was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two 1,710\\xa0hp (1,275\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk 30 had a maximum speed of   at  .  It also carried early electronic countermeasures equipment. 526 were built. Other Mosquito night fighter variants which were planned for, but never built, included the NF Mk X and NF Mk XIV (the latter based on the NF Mk XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The NF Mk 31 was a variant of the NF Mk 30, but powered by Packard Merlins. Mosquito night intruders of 100 Group, Bomber Command, were also fitted with a device called \"Serrate\" to allow them to track down German night fighters from their Lichtenstein B/C and SN-2 radar emissions, as well as a device named \"Perfectos\" that tracked German IFF signals.After the war, two more night fighter versions were developed: The NF Mk 36 was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk X radar. Powered by two 1,690\\xa0hp (1,260\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were   at sea level,   at  , and   at  . The NF Mk 38, 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia.  According to the Pilot\\'s Notes and Air Ministry \\'Special Flying Instruction TF/487\\', which posted limits on the Mosquito\\'s maximum speeds, the NF Mk 38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425\\xa0mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to  . However, from 10,000 to   the maximum speed was 348 knots (400\\xa0mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to   320 knots (368\\xa0mph); 20,000 to  , 295 knots (339\\xa0mph); 25,000 to  , 260 knots (299\\xa0mph); 30,000 to  , 235 knots (270\\xa0mph). With two added 100 gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379\\xa0mph); between 15,000 to   320 knots (368\\xa0mph); 20,000 to  , 295 knots (339\\xa0mph); 25,000 to  , 260 knots (299\\xa0mph); 30,000 to  , 235 knots (270\\xa0mph). Little difference was noted above  .  Fighter-bombersThe FB Mk VI, which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two 1,460\\xa0hp (1,088\\xa0kW) Merlin 21s or 1,635\\xa0hp (1,218\\xa0kW) Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced \"basic\" wing structure capable of carrying single 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) or 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single   or   drop tanks to be carried under each wing.  Streetly 1981 p. 177.  The usual fixed armament was four 20mm Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns, while two 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) or 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bombs could be carried in the bomb bay. Unlike the F Mk II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors.  The maximum fuel load which could be carried was   distributed between   internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of   capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two   drop tanks.  All-out level speed is often given as  , however this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (HJ679) fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be  , in line with expectations.  2,298 FB Mk VIs were built, nearly one-third of Mosquito production.  18 built by Airspeed Ltd were eventually modified to become FB.XVIIIs. Two were converted to TR.33 carrier-borne, maritime strike prototypes.  The FB Mk VI proved capable of holding its own with single-engine fighter aircraft in addition to bombing. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of 143 Squadron were engaged by 30 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 5: nonetheless the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, losing five Mosquitos but shooting down five Fw 190s. Another fighter-bomber variant was the Mosquito FB Mk XVIII (sometimes known as the Tsetse) of which 18 were purpose-built and 27 converted from Mk VIs. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins \"6-pounder Class M\" cannon: this was a modified QF 6-pounder (57\\xa0mm) anti-tank gun fitted with an auto-loader to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire. 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing 1,580\\xa0lb (716\\xa0kg).   In addition, 900\\xa0lb (408\\xa0kg)of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from the heavily armed U-boats which were intended to be the primary target of the Mk XVIII.  Two or four .303 (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to \"sight\" the main weapon onto the target.  The Air Ministry initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.  The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2,950\\xa0ft/s (900\\xa0m/s)  and an excellent range of some 1,800 - 1,500 yards (1,650 - 1,370 m). It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from 5,000\\xa0ft (1,520 m) at a 30° angle with the turn and bank indicator on centre. A move during the dive could jam the cannon.  The prototype HJ732 was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943. The effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 Ju 88s. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March, U-976 was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitos.  On 10 June, U-821 was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a Liberator of No. 206 Squadron.  On 5 April 1945 Mosquitos with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the Kattegat and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them. Bowman 2005, p. 115.   A German Sperrbrecher (pathfinder ship) was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by Swedish vessels.  Some 900 German soldiers died in total.  On 9 April German U-boats U-804, U-843 and U-1065 were spotted in formation heading for Norway. All were sunk.   U-251 and U-2359 followed on 19 April and 2 May 1945. Despite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger 32-pounder, a gun based on the QF 3.7 inch AA gun designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of muzzle brake. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.Designs based on the Mk VI were the FB Mk 26, built in Canada, and the FB Mk 40, built in Australia, powered by Packard Merlins. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using 1,620\\xa0hp (1,207\\xa0kW) single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard.  212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43s tactical assault aircraft. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.  TrainersThe Mosquito was also built as the Mosquito T Mk III two-seat trainer. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the T Mk III were built for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. de Havilland Australia built 11 T Mk 43 trainers, similar to the Mk III. Torpedo-bombersTo meet specification N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33 with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20mm cannon, two 500\\xa0lb bombs in the bomb bay, (another two could be fitted under the wings) eight 60\\xa0lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33\\'s AN/APS-6. Target tugsThe Royal Navy also operated the Mosquito TT Mk 39 for target towing. A number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The RAF\\'s target tug version was the Mosquito TT Mk 35 which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service, finally being retired in 1956. Two ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at Manchester (Ringway) Airport by Fairey Aviation in 1953–1954, being delivered to the Belgian Air Force for use as towing aircraft from the Sylt firing ranges. Canadian-built A total of 1,133  (to 1945) Mosquitos were built by De Havilland Canada at Downsview Airfield in Downsview Ontario (now Downsview Park in Toronto Ontario). Mosquito B Mk VII : Canadian version based on the Mosquito B Mk V bomber aircraft. Powered by two 1,418\\xa0hp (1,057\\xa0kW) Packard Merlin 31 piston engines; 25 built. Mosquito B Mk XX : Canadian version of the Mosquito B Mk IV bomber aircraft; 145 built, of which 40 were converted into F-8 photo-reconnaissance aircraft for the USAAF. Mosquito FB Mk 21 : Canadian version of the Mosquito FB Mk VI fighter-bomber aircraft. Powered by two 1,460\\xa0hp (1,089\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 31 piston engines, three built. Mosquito T Mk 22 : Canadian version of the Mosquito T Mk III training aircraft. Mosquito B Mk 23 : Unused designation for a bomber variant. Mosquito FB Mk 24 : Canadian fighter-bomber version. Powered by two 1,620\\xa0hp (1,208\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 301 piston engines; two built. Mosquito B Mk 25 : Improved version of the Mosquito B Mk XX Bomber aircraft. Powered by two 1,620\\xa0hp (1,208\\xa0kW) Packard Merlin 225 piston engines; 400 built. Mosquito FB Mk 26 : Improved version of the Mosquito FB Mk 21 fighter-bomber aircraft. Powered by two 1,620\\xa0hp (1,208\\xa0kW) Packard Merlin 225 piston engines; 338 built. Mosquito T Mk 27 : Canadian-built training aircraft. Mosquito T Mk 29 : A number of FB Mk 26 fighters were converted into T Mk 29 trainers. Australian-built Mosquito FB Mk 40 : Two-seat fighter-bomber version for the RAAF. Powered by two 1,460\\xa0hp (1,089\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 31 piston engines. A total of 178 built in Australia. Mosquito PR Mk 40 : This designation was given to six FB Mk 40s, which were converted into photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Mosquito FB Mk 41 : Two-seat fighter-bomber version for the RAAF. A total of 11 were built in Australia. Mosquito PR Mk 41 : Two-seat photo-survey version for the RAAF. A total of 17 were built in Australia. Mosquito FB Mk 42 : Two-seat fighter-bomber version. Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 69 piston engines. One FB Mk 40 aircraft was converted into a Mosquito FB Mk 42. Mosquito T Mk 43 : Two-seat training version for the RAAF. A total of 11 FB Mk 40s were converted into Mosquito T Mk 43s. HighballA number of Mosquito IVs were modified by Vickers-Armstrongs to carry Highball \"bouncing bombs\" and were allocated Vickers Type numbers: Type 463 - Prototype Highball conversion of Mosquito IV DZ741. Type 465 - Conversion of 33 Mosquito IVs to carry Highball. Production DetailsIn England, fuselage shells were mainly made by the furniture companies Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll and Styles & Mealing. The specialized wood veneer used in the construction of the Mosquito was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin, United States. Hamilton Roddis had teams of dextrous young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong wood veneer before shipping to the UK. Cole 2001   Wing spars were made by J.B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which was well suited to these tasks because of a well-established furniture manufacturing industry. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their High Wycombe factory.About 5,000 of the 7,781 Mosquitos made contained parts made in High Wycombe.  In Canada, fuselages were built in the Oshawa, Ontario plant of General Motors of Canada Limited. These were shipped to De Havilland Canada in Toronto for mating to fuselages and completion. As a secondary manufacturer, de Havilland Australia started construction in Sydney. These production lines added 1,076 from Canada and 212 from Australia.Total Mosquito production was 7,781 of which 6,710 were built during the war. The ferry operation of the Mosquito from Canada to the war front was problematic, as a small fraction of the aircraft mysteriously disappeared over mid-Atlantic. The theory of \"auto-explosion\" was offered, and, although a concentrated effort at de Havilland Canada to address production problems with engine and oil systems reduced the number of aircraft lost, the actual cause of the losses was not known. The company introduced an additional five hours flight testing to \"clear\" production aircraft before the ferry flight. By the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been delivered successfully by the Canadian operation. In total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR.XVIs to Australia, two FB.VI and 18 NF.30s to Belgium, approximately 205 FB.26, T.29 and T.27s to Nationalist China, 19 FB.VIs to Czechoslovakia in 1948, 6 FB.VIs to Dominica, a few B.IVs, 57 FB.VIs, 29 PR.XVIs and 23 NF.XXXs to France. Some T.IIIs were exported to Israel along with 60 FB.VIs, and at least five PR.XVIs and 14 naval versions. Four T.IIIs, 76 FB.VIs, one FB.40 and four T.43s were exported to New Zealand. Three T.IIIs were exported to Norway, and 18 FB.VIs which were later converted to night fighter standard. South Africa received two F.II and 14 PR.XVI/XIs and Sweden received 46 NF.XIXs. Turkey received 96 FB.VIs and several T.IIIs, and Yugoslavia had 60 NF.38s, 80 FB.VIs and three T.IIIs delivered.

The largest collection of Mosquitos is at the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre in the United Kingdom, which owns three aircraft, including the first prototype, W4050, potentially the only initial prototype of a World War 2 aircraft design still in existence in the 21st century.The Mosquito in flying condition, Mosquito FB.26 KA114, was built in Canada in 1945, was restored by Avspecs Limited of Ardmore, New Zealand; its first post-restoration flight was on 27 September 2012. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth flights were watched by several thousand spectators at a special air show at Ardmore on 29 September. The aircraft is owned by Jerry Yagen and is due to be moved its new home at the Military Aviation Museum, a large collection of flying historic aircraft in Virginia Beach, Virginia. A complete set of forms, jigs and moulds will allow for new Mosquitos to be built. Sixteen years earlier, in July 1996, the then-only airworthy Mosquito, RR299, G-ASKH, was destroyed in an airshow accident at Barton, Manchester; both aircrew were killed. A temporary loss of power in the left engine caused the pilot (with over 10,000 hours of flying experience) to lose control at low level; RR299 hit the ground at high speed in nearby woodland and disintegrated.

Rise of Dost Mohammad Khan  After the decline of the Durrani dynasty in 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan established the Barakzai dynasty after becoming the next Emir of Afghanistan. It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in Kabul, where he proclaimed himself the Shah. Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother\\'s Qizilbash tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, Fateh Khan. Among the many problems he faced was repelling Sikh encroachment on the Pashtun areas east of the Khyber Pass. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, Shuja Shah Durrani, but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. Ranjit Singh\\'s forces occupied Peshawar, moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad\\'s forces, under the command of his son Akbar Khan, defeated the Sikhs at the Battle of Jamrud, a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a pyrrhic victory and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted Lord Auckland, the new British governor general in British India, for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the Great Game lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India. The Great Game  The British became the major power in the Indian sub-continent after the Treaty of Paris (1763) and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with Shuja Shah Durrani. It was the threat of the expanding Russian Empire beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the \"Great Game\". The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose spheres of influence moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain\\'s repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the 19th century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan\\'s fate played out globally. The débâcle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the Hindu Kush area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to South Asia. In the early decades of the 19th century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the Iranians, or the French, but from the Russians, who had already begun a steady advance southward from the Caucasus.At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in Central Asia as the British encroached northward, taking the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir; later to become Pakistan. The British viewed Russia\\'s absorption of the Caucasus, the Kyrgyz and Turkmen lands, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Emirate of Bukhara with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Asian subcontinent.  In addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russia\\'s intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take Herat, historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent, Yan Vitkevich, who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent Alexander Burnes, for commercial discussions.The British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawar\\'s independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.In 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.It soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Auckland\\'s plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah. First Anglo-Afghan War, 1838-1842  To justify his plan, the Governor-General of India Lord Auckland issued the Simla Manifesto in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on India\\'s western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting Shah Shujah\\'s small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shuja\\'s rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government \"against foreign interference and factious opposition\". In November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate cantonments. The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Muhammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Muhammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars\\' demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by Ghilzai tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of 4,500 troops and 12,000 camp followers were killed. Of the British only one, Dr. William Brydon, reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.Afghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General Lord Ellenborough ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass. Mid-nineteenth centuryAfter months of chaos in Kabul, Mohammad Akbar Khan secured local control and in April 1843 his father Dost Mohammad, who had been released by the British, returned to the throne in Afghanistan. In the following decade, Dost Mohammad concentrated his efforts on reconquering Mazari Sharif, Konduz, Badakhshan, and Kandahar. Mohammad Akbar Khan died in 1845. During the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848–49), Dost Mohammad\\'s last effort to take Peshawar failed.By 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855 Treaty of Peshawar reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each side\\'s territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each other\\'s friends and enemies of each other\\'s enemies.In 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar (but not Kabul) during a conflict with the Persians, who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British. In 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence. A few months later, he died. Sher Ali Khan, his third son, and proclaimed successor, failed to recapture Kabul from his older brother, Mohammad Afzal (whose troops were led by his son, Abdur Rahman) until 1868, after which Abdur Rahman retreated across the Amu Darya and bided his time.In the years immediately following the First Anglo-Afghan War, and especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British in India, Liberal Party governments in London took a political view of Afghanistan as a buffer state. By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of Russia, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of Khiva. Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan amir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali. Second Anglo-Afghan War, 1878-1880  After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali tried, but failed, to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878 and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too. The amir not only refused to receive a British mission but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. Lord Lytton, the viceroy, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo-Afghan War. A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to Mazari Sharif, where he died on 21 February 1879. With British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali\\'s son and successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to the British. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and Michni passes, and Afghanistan ceded various frontier areas and Quetta to Britain. The British army then withdrew. Soon afterwards, an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Britain\\'s Resident in Kabul, Sir Pierre Cavagnari and his guards and staff on 3 September 1879, provoking the second phase of the Second Afghan War. Major General Sir Frederick Roberts led the Kabul Field Force over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan, defeated the Afghan Army at Char Asiab on 6 October 1879 and occupied Kabul. Ghazi Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment in December 1879, but his defeat there resulted in the collapse of this rebellion.  Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub\\'s brother Ayub Khan on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Maiwand in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the Battle of Kandahar, bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan\\'s foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew. The Iron Amir, 1880-1901 As far as British interests were concerned, Abdur Rahman answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his country\\'s foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.He achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the Ghilzai, and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of Kafiristan north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to erode as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.In addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions comprising Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized bureaucracy. Despite his distinctly authoritarian personality, Abdur Rahman called for a loya jirga, an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family. During his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute a Muslim Envoy to Kabul having noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan (Saman Burj Wazirabad), a direct descendent of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.Abdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advancement. He brought foreign physicians, engineers (especially for mining), geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahman\\'s foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.The first important frontier dispute was the Panjdeh crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the Merv (now Mary) Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the Panjdeh Oasis were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the region\\'s Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya but also the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.The second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahman\\'s reign was in the Wakhan. The British insisted Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region where unruly Kyrgyz held sway, he had no choice but to accept Britain\\'s compromise. In 1895 and 1896 another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory (although the Chinese did not formally accept this as a boundary between the two countries until 1964.)For Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India (through the Pashtun area) was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir Mortimer Durand, to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts (such as Kurram and Chitral) that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.The Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of demography or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of Pashtunistan or \\'Land of the Pashtuns\\'. (See Siege of Malakand).The clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son, Habibullah Khan, to the throne on his father\\'s death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control. Habibullah Khan, 1901–1919 Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khan\\'s eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his father\\'s more distinguished wife (a granddaughter of Dost Mohammad), who sought the throne for her own son. Although made secure in his position as ruler by virtue of support from the army which was created by his father, Habibullah was not as domineering as Abdur Rahman. Consequently, the influence of religious leaders as well as that of Mahmud Tarzi, a cousin of the king, increased during his reign.  Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet and journalist, founded an Afghan nationalist newspaper with Habibullah\\'s agreement, and until 1919 he used the newspaper as a platform for rebutting clerical criticism of Western-influenced changes in government and society, for espousing full Afghan independence, and for other reforms. Tarzi\\'s passionate Afghan nationalism influenced a future generation of Asian reformers.The boundary with Iran was firmly delineated in 1904, replacing the ambiguous line made by a British commission in 1872. Agreement could not be reached, however, on sharing the waters of the Helmand River.Like all foreign policy developments of this period affecting Afghanistan, the conclusion of the \"Great Game\" between Russia and Britain occurred without the Afghan ruler\\'s participation. The 1907 Anglo-Russian Entente (the Convention of St. Petersburg) not only divided the region into separate areas of Russian and British influence but also established foundations for Afghan neutrality. The convention provided for Russian acquiescence that Afghanistan was now outside this sphere of influence, and for Russia to consult directly with Britain on matters relating to Russian-Afghan relations. Britain, for its part, would not occupy or annex Afghan territory, or interfere in Afghanistan\\'s internal affairs.During World War I, Afghanistan remained neutral despite pressure to support Turkey when its sultan proclaimed his nation\\'s participation in what it considered a holy war. Habibullah did, however, entertain an Indo-German-Turkish mission in Kabul in 1915 that had as its titular head the Indian nationalist Mahendra Pratap and was led by Oskar Niedermayer and the German legate Werner Otto von Hentig. After much procrastination, he won an agreement from the Central Powers for a huge payment and arms provision in exchange for attacking British India. But the crafty Afghan ruler clearly viewed the war as an opportunity to play one side off against the other, for he also offered the British to resist a Central Powers attack on India in exchange for an end to British control of Afghan foreign policy.== Third Anglo-Afghan War and Independence ==   Amanullah\\'s ten years of reign initiated a period of dramatic change in Afghanistan in both foreign and domestic politics. Amanullah declared full independence and sparked the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah altered foreign policy in his new relations with external powers and transformed domestic politics with his social, political, and economic reforms. Although his reign ended abruptly, he achieved some notable successes, and his efforts failed as much due to the centrifugal forces of tribal Afghanistan and the machinations of Russia and Britain as to any political folly on his part.Amanullah came to power just as the entente between Russia and Britain broke down following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Once again Afghanistan provided a stage on which the great powers played out their schemes against one another. Keen to modernise his country and free it from foreign domination, Amanullah, sought to shore up his powerbase. Amidst intrigue in the Afghan court, and political and civil unrest in India, he sought to divert attention from the internal divisions of Afghanistan and unite all faction behind him by attacking the British. Using the civil unrest in India as an excuse to move troops to the Durand Line, Afghan troops crossed the border at the western end of the Khyber Pass on 3 May 1919 and occupied the village of Bagh, the scene of an earlier uprising in April. Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23  In response, the Indian government ordered a full mobilisation and on 6 May 1919 declared war. For the British it had come at a time when they were still recovering from the First World War. The troops that were stationed in India were mainly reserves and Territorials, who were awaiting demobilisation and keen to return to Britain, whilst the few regular regiments that were available were tired and depleted from five years of fighting. Afghan forces achieved success in the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen from both sides of the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, armoured cars, motor transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive. British forces used airpower to shock the Afghans, and the King\\'s home was directly attacked in what is the first case of aerial bombardment in Afghanistan\\'s history. The attacks played a key role in forcing an armistice but brought an angry rebuke from King Amanullah. He wrote: \"It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation. While we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent among all civilized people of the west\" The fighting concluded in August 1919 and Britain virtually dictated the terms of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919, a temporary armistice that provided, on one somewhat ambiguous interpretation, for Afghan self-determination in foreign affairs.  Before final negotiations were concluded in 1921, however, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy without repercussions anyway, including diplomatic relations with the new government in the Soviet Union in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries. Amanullah Khan, 1919–1929  On 20 February 1919, Habibullah Khan was assassinated on a hunting trip. He had not declared a succession, but left his third son, Amanullah Khan, in charge in Kabul. Amanullah did have an older brother, Nasrullah Khan.  But, because Amanullah controlled both the national treasury and the army, Amanullah was well situated to seize power. The army\\'s support allowed Amanullah to suppress other claims and imprison those relatives who would not swear loyalty to him. Within a few months, the new amir had gained the allegiance of most tribal leaders and established control over the cities. Amanullah Khan\\'s reforms were heavily influenced by Europe. This came through the influence of Mahmud Tarzi, who was both Amanullah Khan\\'s father-in-law and Foreign Minister. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet, journalist, and diplomat, was a key figure that brought Western dress and etiquette to Afghanistan. He also fought for progressive reforms such as woman\\'s rights, educational rights, and freedom of press. All of these influences, brought by Tarzi and others, were welcomed by Amanullah Khan.In 1926, Amanullah ended the Emirate of Afghanistan and proclaimed the Kingdom of Afghanistan with himself as king. In 1927 and 1928, King Amanullah Khan and his wife Soraya Tarzi visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen of Afghanistan received honorary degrees from Oxford University. This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to modernization. King Amanullah was so impressed with the social progress of Europe that he tried to implement them right away, this met with heavy resistance from the conservative sect and eventually lead to his demise.Amanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his power to modernize the country. Amanullah created new cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the region and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. He created a new capital city and increased trade with Europe and Asia. He also advanced a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms. This rapid modernization though, created a backlash, and a reactionary uprising known as the Khost rebellion which was suppressed in 1924.After Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927, opposition to his rule increased. An uprising in Jalalabad culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted rather than resist.  On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother, King Inayatullah Khan.  On 17 January, Inayatullah abdicated and Habibullah Kalakani became the next ruler of Afghanistan and restored the emirate. However, his rule was short lived and, on 17 October 1929, Habibullah Kalakani was overthrown and replaced by King Nadir Khan.After his abdication in 1929, Amanullah went into temporary exile in India.  When he attempted to return to Afghanistan, he had little support from the people. From India, the ex-king traveled to Europe and settled in Italy, and later in Switzerland. Meanwhile, Nadir Khan made sure his return to Afghanistan was impossible by engaging in a propaganda war. Nadir Khan accused Amanullah Khan of kufr with his pro western policies. Mohammed Zahir Shah, 1933–1973  In 1933, after the assassination of Nadir Khan, Mohammed Zahir Shah became king.

Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may both occur.The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which graphically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration, and rapid  reactions are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of extra energy other than thermal energy. Non-spontaneous reactions run so slowly that they are considered to require the input of some type of additional energy (such as extra heat, light or electricity) in order to proceed to completion (chemical equilibrium) at human time scales.Different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product. In biochemistry, a similar series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. These enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions may be performed at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell.The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to non-chemical reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays, and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory. HistoryChemical reactions such as combustion in the fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by Alchemists. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur. The production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried, such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān. The process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in 1880s,  and the Haber process  was developed in 1909–1910 for ammonia synthesis. From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called \"phlogiston\", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of John Dalton, Joseph Proust had developed the law of definite proportions, which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations. Regarding the organic chemistry, it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically. According to the concept of vitalism, organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\" and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by Friedrich Wöhler in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include Alexander William Williamson with his synthesis of ethers and Christopher Kelk Ingold, who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of substitution reactions. EquationsChemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (→) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction; the arrow is read as the word \"yields\".  The tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds. A double arrow ( ) pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions. Equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry, the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation. This is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules (A, B, C and D in a schematic example below) by the appropriate integers a, b, c and d.   \\\\mathrm{a\\\\ A + b\\\\ B \\\\longrightarrow c\\\\ C + d\\\\ D}  More elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a minus sign.   Retrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction. Here the analysis starts from the products, for example by splitting selected chemical bonds, to arrive at plausible initial reagents. A special arrow (⇒) is used in retro reactions.  Elementary reactionsThe elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed to, it has no intermediate products.  Most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially. The actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism. An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time.  The most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa. In a typical dissociation reaction, a bond in a molecule splits (ruptures) resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged ions. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions, such as hydrogen–oxygen or polymerization reactions.  \\\\mathrm{AB \\\\longrightarrow A + B}    Dissociation of a molecule AB into fragments A and B   For bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called  chemical synthesis or an addition reaction.  \\\\mathrm{A + B \\\\longrightarrow AB}  Another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called metathesis.  \\\\mathrm{HA + B \\\\longrightarrow A + HB}  for example NaCl (aq)  + AgNO 3  (aq)  → NaNO 3  (aq)  + AgCl (s)  Chemical equilibrium  Most chemical reactions are reversible, that is they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier\\'s principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas. The reaction yield stabilized at equilibrium, but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or increasing temperature or pressure. Change in the initial concentrations of the substances does not affect the equilibrium. ThermodynamicsChemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic, that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy:   \\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta H - T \\\\cdot \\\\Delta S}.    G: free energy, H: enthalpy, T: temperature, S: entropy, Δ: difference(change between original and product)   Reactions can be exothermic, where ΔH is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization, in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in endothermic reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous reaction products, which have high entropy. Since the entropy increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures. Changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the direction of a reaction, as in the Boudouard reaction:  \\\\mathrm{CO_2 + C \\\\rightleftharpoons 2\\\\ CO\\\\ ; \\\\quad \\\\Delta H = +172.45\\\\  kJ \\\\cdot mol^{-1}}.  This reaction between carbon dioxide and carbon to form carbon monoxide is endothermic at temperatures above approximately 800 °C and is exothermic below this temperature. Reactions can also be characterized by the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and chemical potential. The latter depends, among other things, on the activities of the involved substances.   \\\\mathrm{d}U = T\\\\, {d}S - p\\\\, {d}V + \\\\mu\\\\, {d}n \\\\!    U: internal energy, S: entropy, p: pressure, μ: chemical potential, n: number of molecules, d: small change sign   KineticsThe speed at which a reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics. The rate depends on various parameters, such as: Reactant concentrations, which usually make the reaction happen at a faster rate if raised through increased collisions per unit time. Some reactions, however, have rates that are independent of reactant concentrations.  These are called zero order reactions. Surface area available for contact between the reactants, in particular solid ones in heterogeneous systems. Larger surface areas lead to higher reaction rates. Pressure – increasing the pressure decreases the volume between molecules and therefore increases the frequency of collisions between the molecules. Activation energy, which is defined as the amount of energy required to make the reaction start and carry on spontaneously. Higher activation energy implies that the reactants need more energy to start than a reaction with a lower activation energy. Temperature, which hastens reactions if raised, since higher temperature increases the energy of the molecules, creating more collisions per unit time, The presence or absence of a catalyst. Catalysts are substances which change the pathway (mechanism) of a reaction which in turn increases the speed of a reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to take place. A catalyst is not destroyed or changed during a reaction, so it can be used again. For some reactions, the presence of electromagnetic radiation, most notably ultraviolet light, is needed to promote the breaking of bonds to start the reaction.  This is particularly true for reactions involving radicals. Several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate v of a first-order reaction, which could be disintegration of a substance A, is given by:   v= -\\\\frac {d[\\\\mathrm{A}]}{dt}= k \\\\cdot [\\\\mathrm{A}].   Its integration yields:  \\\\mathrm{[A]}(t) = \\\\mathrm{[A]}_{0} \\\\cdot e^{-k\\\\cdot t}.   Here k is first-order rate constant having dimension 1/time, [A](t) is concentration at a time t and [A] 0  is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic half-life. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the Arrhenius equation:  k = k_0 e^   where E a  is the activation energy and k B  is the Boltzmann constant. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory, the calculation of the potential energy surface, the Marcus theory and the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory.  Reaction types Four basic types Synthesis  In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: A + B → AB Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide: 8Fe + S 8  → 8FeS Another example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water. To react or not to react?. Utah State Office of Education. Retrieved 4 June 2011.  Decomposition  A decomposition reaction is the opposite of a synthesis reaction, where a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. These reactions are in the general form: AB → A + B  Six Types of Chemical Reactions – MrGuch ChemFiesta.  One example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas: 2H 2 O → 2H 2  + O 2  Single replacementIn a single replacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound; in order words, one element trades places with another element in a compound  These reactions come in the general form of: A + BC → AC + B One example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas: Mg + 2H 2 O → Mg(OH) 2  + H 2  Double replacementIn a double replacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds.  These reactions are in the general form: AB + CD → AD + CB  For example, when barium chloride (BaCl 2 ) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) reaction, the SO 4  2-  anion switches places with the 2Cl -  anion, giving the compounds BaSO 4  and MgCl 2 . Another example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead(II) nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate: Pb(NO 3 ) 2  + 2 KI → PbI 2  + 2 KNO 3  Oxidation and reduction Redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species (reducing agent) to another (oxidizing agent). In this process, the former species is oxidized and the latter is reduced, thus the term redox. Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation number, but there are many reactions that are classed as \"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).  An example of a redox reaction is: 2 S 2 O 3  2−  (aq)  + I 2  (aq)  → S 4 O 6  2–  (aq)  + 2 I −  (aq)  Here I 2  is reduced to I –  and S 2 O 3  2–  (thiosulfate anion) is oxidized to S 4 O 6  2– .Which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements. Elements with low electronegativity, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize – they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.The number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from electron configuration of the reactant element. Elements are trying to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron, respectively, and the noble gases themselves are chemically inactive. An important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions, where the electrons from the power supply are used as a reducing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as chlorine  or aluminium. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and is used in the batteries. Complexation In complexation reactions, several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.  Acid-base reactionsAcid-base reactions involve transfer of protons from one molecule (acid) to another (base). Here, acids act as proton donors and bases as acceptors.  \\\\mathrm{HA + B \\\\rightleftharpoons A^- + HB^+}    Acid-base reaction, HA: acid, B: Base, A – : conjugated base, HB + : conjugated acid   The associated proton transfer results in the so-called conjugate acid and conjugate base.  The reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (K a  and K b ) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral salt.Acid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are: Arrhenius definition: Acids dissociate in water releasing H 3 O +  ions; bases dissociate in water releasing OH –  ions. Brønsted-Lowry definition: Acids are proton (H + ) donors, bases are proton acceptors; this includes the Arrhenius definition. Lewis definition: Acids are electron-pair acceptors, bases are electron-pair donors; this includes the Brønsted-Lowry definition. Precipitation Precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit  and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.  Solid-state reactionsReactions can take place between two solids. However, because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids, the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions. They are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area.  Photochemical reactions In photochemical reactions, atoms and molecules absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. Photochemical reactions include hydrogen–oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions and rearrangement reactions. Many important processes involve photochemistry. The premier example is photosynthesis, in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin. Christophe Dugave Cis-trans isomerization in biochemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2006 ISBN 3-527-31304-4 p. 56  In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence.  Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry. Catalysis  In catalysis, the reaction does not proceed directly, but through a third substance known as catalyst. Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself; however, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogenous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors.   Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.Heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.  Reactions in organic chemistryIn organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers. SubstitutionIn a substitution reaction, a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group.    These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic, electrophilic or radical substitution.  In the first type, a nucleophile, an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom or part of the \"substrate\" molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion, alkoxides, amines and halides. This type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon. The latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, S N 1 and S N 2. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.   The S N 1 reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation. This is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile. In the S N 2 mechanism, the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule, and only then the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products. S N 1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of geometric isomers (cis/trans). In contrast, a reversal (Walden inversion) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the S N 2 mechanism. Electrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an electrophile, has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups, carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophile attack results in the so-called σ-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, S E 1 and S E 2    In the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a radical.  This process usually takes the form of a chain reaction, for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.   \\\\mathrm{X{\\\\cdot} + R{-}H \\\\longrightarrow X{-}H + R{\\\\cdot}}   \\\\mathrm{R{\\\\cdot} + X_2 \\\\longrightarrow R{-}X + X{\\\\cdot}}    Reactions during the chain reaction of radical substitution   Addition and eliminationThe addition and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions which change the number of substitutents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton (deprotonation). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base.  Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the S N 1 substitution.     The E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the S N 2-substitution.  The counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the Markovnikov\\'s rule.  This rule states that \"In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.\" If the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the hydroboration–oxidation reaction, where in the first step, the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom. While the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.   Nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the Michael reaction, which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C-C bonds.   Some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles, can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization.  Other organic reaction mechanisms  In a rearrangement reaction, the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. These include hydride shift reactions such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, where a hydrogen, alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the Cope rearrangement. Cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and, more generally, pericyclic reactions, wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule. An important example of cycloaddition reaction is the Diels–Alder reaction (the so-called [4+2] cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system. Whether or not a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light.  Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.  Biochemical reactions Biochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes. These proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction, so that reactions can be controlled very precisely. The reaction takes place in the active site, a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization. The catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape (\"induced fit\"), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others. The biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism. Among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism, in which different DNA and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units.  Bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions. An important energy source is glucose, which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food. All organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions. Applications Chemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores. It is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents, energy inputs and waste. Catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate.  Some specific reactions have their niche applications. For example, the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.  MonitoringMechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored  at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.

At the foundation of the new rule, they were called Hermits of St Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites), and did not assume the appellation of Celestines until after the election of their founder to the Papacy as Celestine V.  The fame of the holy life and the austerities practised by the hermit in his solitude on the Mountain of Majella, near Sulmona, attracted many visitors, several of whom were moved to remain and share his mode of life. They built a small convent on the spot inhabited by the holy hermit, which became too small for the accommodation of those who came to share their life of privations. Peter of Morone, their founder built a number of other small oratories in that neighborhood. FoundingThis happened about the year 1254. A new religious community was formed, and Peter of Morone gave them a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved by Urban IV. The founder, having heard that it was probable that Pope Gregory X, then holding a council at Lyon, would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the Lateran Council, having commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, went to Lyon. There he  succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the rule of Saint Benedict, but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Peter the hermit of Morone lived to see himself \"Superior-General\" to thirty-six monasteries and more than six hundred monks. Peter, however, cannot be accused of ambition or the lust of power when a monastic superior, any more than when he insisted on divesting himself of the Papacy, to which he was subsequently raised. As soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to a still more remote solitude to give himself up more entirely to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of Majella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the monastery which had been founded in Sulmtona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, as it has continued to be to the present day. The next year Peter of Morrone, having been, despite his reluctance, elected Pope by the name of Celestine V, the order he had founded took the name of Celestines. The hermit Pope found time in the few short months of his Papacy to confirm the rule of the order, which he had himself composed, and to confer on the society a variety of special graces and privileges. In the only creation of cardinals promoted by him, among the twelve raised to the purple, there were two monks of his order. He found time also to visit personally the great Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino, where he succeeded in persuading the monks to accept his more rigorous rule. He sent fifty monks of his order to introduce it, who remained, however, for only a few months.After the death of the founder the order was favoured and privileged by Benedict XI, and rapidly spread through Italy, Germany, Flanders, and France, where they were received by Philip the Fair in 1300. Subsequently the French Celestines, with the consent of the Italian superiors of the order, and of Pope Martin V in 1427, obtained the privilege of making new constitutions for themselves, which they did in the 17th century in a series of regulations accepted by the provincial chapter in 1667. At that time the French congregation of the order was composed of twenty-one monasteries, the head of which was that of Paris, and was governed by a Provincial with the authority of General. Paul V was a notable benefactor of the order. But in consequence of later political changes and events the order has been dissolved. Description of orderAccording to their special constitutions the Celestines were bound to say matins in the choir at two o\\'clock in the morning, and always to abstain from eating meat, save in illness. The distinct rules of their order with regard to fasting are numerous, but not more severe than those of similar congregations, though much more so than is required by the old Benedictine rule. In reading their minute directions for divers degrees of abstinence on various days, it is impossible to avoid being struck by the conviction that the great object of the framers of these rules was the general purpose of ensuring an ascetic mode of life.The Celestines wore a white woollen cassock bound with a linen band, and a leathern girdle of the same colour, with a scapular unattached to the body of the dress, and a black hood. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of serge. Their dress in short was very like that of the Cistercians. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of San Pietro in Montorio originally belonged to the Celestines in Rome; but they were turned out of it by Sixtus IV to make way for Franciscans, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of St Eusebius of Vercelli with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.

Delta (uppercase Δ, lowercase δ;   Délta; Modern Greek  ) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4. It was derived from the Phoenician letter Dalet . Letters that come from delta include Latin D and Cyrillic Д.A river delta (originally, the Nile River delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle).

It is romanized as d or dh.  The capital letter Delta (Δ, which has the convenient form of an equilateral triangle) is commonly used in subjects of science and mathematics, often to describe change: this is because delta is the initial letter of the Greek word διαφορά, diaphorá, \"difference\" (the small Latin letter d is used in much the same way for the notation of derivatives and differentials, which also describe change).

Namely,   for a positive\\xa0 ,   for a negative\\xa0 , and  . For example, the absolute value of\\xa03 is 3, and the absolute value of\\xa0−3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers, the quaternions, ordered rings, fields and vector spaces. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude, distance, and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts. Terminology and notationJean-Robert Argand introduced the term \"module\", meaning \\'unit of measure\\' in French, in 1806 specifically for the complex absolute value Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision, June 2008   and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent \"modulus\".  The term \"absolute value\" has been used in this sense since at least 1806 in French  and 1857 in English.  The notation   was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841.  Other names for absolute value include \"the numerical value\"  and \"the magnitude\". The same notation is used with sets to denote cardinality; the meaning depends on context. Definition and properties Real numbersFor any real number\\xa0  the absolute value or modulus of\\xa0  is denoted by   (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity) and is defined as   |x| = \\\\begin{cases} x, & \\\\mbox{if }  x \\\\ge 0  \\\\\\\\ -x,  & \\\\mbox{if } x   As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of\\xa0  is always either positive or zero, but never negative.From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number\\'s distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of  the absolute value of the difference (see \"Distance\" below).Since the square-root notation without sign represents the positive square root, it follows that |- | style=\"width: 250px\" |  |a| = \\\\sqrt{a^2}  | ( ) |}which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value. The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties: |- | style=\"width: 250px\" | |a| \\\\ge 0   | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) | Non-negativity |- | |a| = 0 \\\\iff a = 0   | ( ) |Positive-definiteness |- | |ab| = |a||b|\\\\,  | ( ) |Multiplicativeness |- | |a+b|  \\\\le |a| + |b|    | ( ) |Subadditivity |}Other important properties of the absolute value include: |- | style=\"width:250px\" | ||a|| = |a|\\\\,  | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) |Idempotence (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value) |- | style=\"width:250px\" | |-a| = |a|\\\\,  | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) |Symmetry |- | |a - b| = 0 \\\\iff a = b   | ( ) |Identity of indiscernibles (equivalent to positive-definiteness) |- | |a - b|  \\\\le |a - c| +|c - b|    | ( ) |Triangle inequality (equivalent to subadditivity) |- | |a/b| = |a| / |b| \\\\mbox{ (if } b \\\\ne 0) \\\\,  | ( ) |Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness) |- | |a-b| \\\\ge ||a| - |b||   | ( ) |(equivalent to subadditivity) |}Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:  |a| \\\\le b \\\\iff -b \\\\le a \\\\le b    |a| \\\\ge b \\\\iff a \\\\le -b \\\\mbox{ or } b \\\\le a   These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example: |- | |x-3| \\\\le 9   | \\\\iff -9 \\\\le x-3 \\\\le 9   |- | | \\\\iff -6 \\\\le x \\\\le 12   |}Absolute value is used to define the absolute difference, the standard metric on the real numbers. Complex numbersSince the complex numbers are not ordered, the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalized. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance in the complex plane from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem. More generally the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.For any complex number  z = x + iy,\\\\,  where   and   are real numbers, the absolute value or modulus of\\xa0  is denoted   and is given by  |z| =  \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.  When  the complex part   is zero this is the same as the absolute value of the real number\\xa0 .When a complex number\\xa0  is expressed in polar form as  z = r e^{i \\\\theta}  with   and θ real, its absolute value is   |z| = r . The absolute value of a complex number can be written in the complex analogue of equation\\xa0(1) above as:   |z| = \\\\sqrt{z \\\\cdot \\\\overline{z}}   where  \\\\overline z  is the complex conjugate of\\xa0 . The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in equations\\xa0(2)–(11) above.Since the positive reals form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, we may think of absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers.  Absolute value function The real absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It is differentiable everywhere except for  \\xa0=\\xa00.  It is monotonically decreasing on the interval   and monotonically increasing on the interval  . Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an even function, and is hence not invertible.Both the real and complex functions are idempotent.It is a piecewise linear, convex function. Relationship to the sign functionThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the sign (or signum) function returns a number\\'s sign irrespective of its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions:  |x| = x \\\\sgn(x),  and for  ,  \\\\sgn(x) = \\\\frac{|x|}{x}.  DerivativeThe real absolute value function has a derivative for every  , but is not differentiable at  . Its derivative for   is given by the step function Weisstein, Eric W. Absolute Value. From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource.  Bartel and Sherbert, p.\\xa0163   \\\\frac{d|x|}{dx} = \\\\frac{x}{|x|} = \\\\begin{cases} -1 & x 0. \\\\end{cases}  The subdifferential of\\xa0  at\\xa0  is the interval\\xa0 . The complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable nowhere because it violates the Cauchy–Riemann equations. The second derivative of\\xa0  with respect to\\xa0  is zero everywhere except zero, where it does not exist. As a generalized function, the second derivative may be taken as two times the Dirac delta function. AntiderivativeThe antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the absolute value function is  \\\\int|x|dx=\\\\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,  where   is an arbitrary constant of integration. Distance  The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.The standard Euclidean distance between two points  a = (a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n)   and  b = (b_1, b_2, \\\\dots , b_n)   in Euclidean  -space is defined as:  \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}.   This can be seen to be a generalization of  , since if   and   are real, then by equation\\xa0(1),  |a - b| = \\\\sqrt{(a - b)^2}.  While if   a = a_1 + i a_2 \\\\,  and   b = b_1 + i b_2 \\\\,  are complex numbers, then |- | |a - b| \\\\,  |  = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\\\\,  |- | |  = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\\\\,  |- | |  = \\\\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}.  |}The above shows that the \"absolute value\" distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows:A real valued function   on a set   is called a metric (or a distance function) on\\xa0 , if it satisfies the following four axioms:  |- |style=\"width:250px\" |  d(a, b) \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | d(a, b) = 0 \\\\iff a = b   |Identity of indiscernibles |- | d(a, b) = d(b, a) \\\\,  |Symmetry |- | d(a, b)  \\\\le d(a, c) + d(c, b)    |Triangle inequality |} Generalizations Ordered ringsThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring. That is, if\\xa0  is an element of an ordered ring\\xa0R, then the absolute value of\\xa0 , denoted by  , is defined to be:   |a| = \\\\begin{cases} a, & \\\\mbox{if }  a \\\\ge 0  \\\\\\\\ -a,  & \\\\mbox{if } a \\\\le 0 \\\\end{cases} \\\\;   where   is the additive inverse of\\xa0 , and 0 is the additive identity element. Fields  The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in (2)–(5) above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.A real-valued function\\xa0  on a field\\xa0F is called an absolute value (also a modulus, magnitude, value, or valuation)  if it satisfies the following four axioms: |- | v(a) \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | v(a) = 0 \\\\iff a = \\\\mathbf{0}   |Positive-definiteness |- | v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \\\\,  |Multiplicativeness |- | v(a+b)  \\\\le v(a) + v(b)    |Subadditivity or the triangle inequality |}Where 0 denotes the additive identity element of\\xa0F. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativeness that  , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity element of\\xa0F. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.If   is an absolute value on\\xa0F, then the function\\xa0  on  , defined by  , is a metric and the following are equivalent: d satisfies the ultrametric inequality  d(x, y) \\\\leq \\\\max(d(x,z),d(y,z))  for all  ,  ,   in\\xa0F.   \\\\big\\\\{ v\\\\Big({\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^n } \\\\mathbf{1}\\\\Big) : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\big\\\\}   is bounded in\\xa0R.   v\\\\Big({\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^n } \\\\mathbf{1}\\\\Big) \\\\le 1 \\\\text{ for every } n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}.    v(a) \\\\le 1 \\\\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\\\le 1 \\\\text{ for all } a \\\\in F.    v(a + b) \\\\le \\\\mathrm{max}\\\\{v(a), v(b)\\\\} \\\\text{ for all } a, b \\\\in F.  An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be non-Archimedean, otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.  Vector spaces  Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.A real-valued function on a vector space\\xa0V over a field\\xa0F, represented as ‖V‖, is called an absolute value (or more usually a norm) if it satisfies the following axioms:For all\\xa0  in\\xa0F, and v, u in\\xa0V, |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|  \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| = 0 \\\\iff \\\\mathbf{v} = 0  |Positive-definiteness |- | \\\\|a \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| = |a| \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|   |Positive homogeneity or positive scalability |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\| \\\\le \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\|   |Subadditivity or the triangle inequality |}The norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude.In the case of Euclidean space\\xa0R n , the function defined by  \\\\|(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots , x_n) \\\\| = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}  is a norm called the Euclidean norm. When the real numbers\\xa0R are considered as the one-dimensional vector space\\xa0R 1 , the absolute value is a norm, and is the  -norm for any\\xa0 . In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on R 1 , in the sense that, for every norm   on\\xa0R 1 ,  . The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an inner product space. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane\\xa0R 2 .

The \"function\" is the solution of a problem and the \"arguments\" are the data in the problem.A problem with a low condition number is said to be well-conditioned, while a problem with a high condition number is said to be ill-conditioned.The condition number is a property of the problem.  Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution.  Some algorithms have a property called backward stability. In general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems. Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify the backward stable algorithms.As a general rule of thumb, if the condition number  \\\\kappa(A) = 10^k , then you may lose up to  k  digits of accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss of precision from arithmetic methods. Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid.  However, the condition number does not give the exact value of the maximum inaccuracy that may occur in the algorithm. It generally just bounds it with an estimate (whose computed value depends on the choice of the norm to measure the inaccuracy). ==Matrices== For example, the condition number associated with the linear equation Ax\\xa0=\\xa0b gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution x will be after approximation. Note that this is before the effects of round-off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating point accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution, x, will change with respect to a change in b.  Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in b may cause a large error in x. On the other hand, if the condition number is small then the error in x will not be much bigger than the error in b.The condition number is defined more precisely to be the maximum ratio of the relative error in x divided by the relative error in b.Let e be the error in b. Assuming that A is a square matrix, the error in the solution A −1 b is A −1 e. The ratio of the relative error in the solution to the relative error in b is   \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} b \\\\right\\\\Vert }{ \\\\left\\\\Vert e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert b \\\\right\\\\Vert } .  This is easily transformed to   \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert e \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\Vert b \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} b \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\right) .  The maximum value (for nonzero b and e) is easily seen to be the product of the two operator norms:   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\cdot \\\\left\\\\Vert A \\\\right\\\\Vert .  The same definition is used for any  consistent norm, i.e. one that satisfies   \\\\kappa(A) \\\\ge 1 .\\\\,  When the condition number is exactly one, then the algorithm may find an approximation of the solution with an arbitrary precision. However it does not mean that the algorithm will converge rapidly to this solution, just that it won\\'t diverge arbitrarily because of inaccuracy on the source data (backward error), provided that the forward error introduced by the algorithm does not diverge as well because of accumulating intermediate rounding errors.The condition number may also be infinite, in which case the algorithm will not reliably find a solution to the problem, not even a weak approximation of it (and not even its order of magnitude) with any reasonable and provable accuracy.Of course, this definition depends on the choice of norm: If   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|   is the norm (usually noted as   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|_2  ) defined in the square-summable sequence space ℓ 2  (which also matches the usual distance in a continuous and isotropic cartesian space), then   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\max}(A)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\min}(A)} ,  where   \\\\sigma_{\\\\max}(A)  and  \\\\sigma_{\\\\min}(A)   are maximal and minimal singular values of  A  respectively. Hence If  A  is normal then   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\left|\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{\\\\max}(A)}{\\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(A)}\\\\right| ,  where   \\\\lambda_{\\\\max}(A)  and  \\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(A)   are maximal and minimal (by moduli) eigenvalues of  A  respectively. If  A  is unitary then   \\\\kappa(A) = 1 .\\\\,  This number arises so often in numerical linear algebra that it is given a name, the condition number of a matrix. If   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|   is the norm (usually noted as   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty  ) defined in the sequence space ℓ ∞  of all bounded sequences (which also matches the non-linear distance measured as the maximum of distances measured on projections into the base subspaces, without requiring the space to be isotropic or even just linear, but only continuous, such norm being definable on all Banach spaces), and  A  is lower triangular non-singular (i.e.,   \\\\forall i, a_{ii} \\\\ne 0 \\\\, ) then   \\\\kappa(A) \\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\max_i(|a_{ii}|)}{\\\\min_i(|a_{ii}|)} .  The condition number computed with this norm is generally larger than the condition number computed with square-summable sequences, but it can be evaluated more easily (and this is often the only measurable condition number, when the problem to solve involves a non-linear algebra, for example when approximating irrational and transcendental functions or numbers with numerical methods.) If the condition number is close to one, the matrix is well conditioned which means its inverse can be computed with good accuracy. If the condition number is large, then the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. Practically, such a matrix is almost singular, and the computation of its inverse, or solution of a linear system of equations is prone to large numerical errors. A matrix that is not invertible has the condition number equal to infinity. Other contexts Condition numbers can be defined for any function ƒ mapping its data from some domain (e.g. an m-tuple of real numbers x) into some codomain [e.g. an n-tuple of real numbers ƒ(x)], where both the domain and codomain are Banach spaces.  They express how sensitive that function is to small changes (or small errors) in its arguments.  This is crucial in assessing the sensitivity and potential accuracy difficulties of numerous computational problems, for example polynomial root finding or computing eigenvalues.  The condition number of ƒ at a point x (specifically, its relative condition number ) is then defined to be the maximum ratio of the fractional change in ƒ(x) to any fractional change in x, in the limit where the change δx in x becomes infinitesimally small: L.

For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers. The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted |\\u2009A\\u2009|, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set A may be denoted by n(A),  A , card(A), or #\\u2009A. Comparing sets Case 1: |\\u2009A\\u2009| = |\\u2009B\\u2009| Two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection, that is, an injective and surjective function, from A to B. For example, the set E = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} of non-negative even numbers has the same cardinality as the set N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} of natural numbers, since the function f(n) = 2n is a bijection from N to E. Case 2: |\\u2009A\\u2009| ≥ |\\u2009B\\u2009| A has cardinality greater than or equal to the cardinality of B if there exists an injective function from B into A. Case 3: |\\u2009A\\u2009| > |\\u2009B\\u2009| A has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of B if there is an injective function, but no bijective function, from B to A. For example, the set R of all real numbers has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set N of all natural numbers, because the inclusion map i : N → R is injective, but it can be shown that there does not exist a bijective function from N to R (see Cantor\\'s diagonal argument or Cantor\\'s first uncountability proof). Cardinal numbers Above, \"cardinality\" was defined functionally. That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.The relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A. There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\": The cardinality of a set A is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity. A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class. This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory. The cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted  \\\\aleph_0   For each ordinal α,   α + 1  is the least cardinal number greater than   α .The cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (  0 ), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by c, and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor showed, using the diagonal argument, that c>  0 . We can show that c = 2   0  ; this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The continuum hypothesis says that   1  = 2   0  , i.e. 2   0   is the smallest cardinal number bigger than   0 , i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis still remains unresolved in an \"absolute\" sense.  See below for more details on the cardinality of the continuum. Finite, countable and uncountable setsIf the axiom of choice holds, the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions: Any set X with cardinality less than that of the natural numbers, or |\\u2009X\\u2009|  0 , is said to be a countably infinite set. Any set X with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or |\\u2009X\\u2009| > |\\u2009N\\u2009|, for example |\\u2009R\\u2009| = c > |\\u2009N\\u2009|, is said to be  uncountable. Infinite setsOur intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. In the late nineteenth century Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is Hilbert\\'s paradox of the Grand Hotel.The reason for this is that the various characterizations of what it means for set A to be larger than set B, or to be the same size as set B, which are all equivalent for finite sets, are no longer equivalent for infinite sets. Different characterizations can yield different results. For example, in the popular characterization of size chosen by Cantor, sometimes an infinite set A is larger (in that sense) than an infinite set B; while other characterizations  may yield that an infinite set A is always the same size as an infinite set B.For finite sets, counting is just forming a bijection (i.e., a one-to-one correspondence) between the set being counted and an initial segment of the positive integers. Thus there is no notion equivalent to counting for infinite sets. While counting gives a unique result when applied to a finite set, an infinite set may be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with many different ordinal numbers depending on how one chooses to \"count\" (order) it.Additionally, different characterizations of size, when extended to infinite sets, will break different \"rules\" which held for finite sets. Which rules are broken varies from characterization to characterization. For example, Cantor\\'s characterization, while preserving the rule that sometimes one set is larger than another, breaks the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller. Another characterization may preserve the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller, but break another rule.  Furthermore, some characterization may not \"directly\" break a rule, but it may not \"directly\" uphold it either, in the sense that whichever is the case depends upon a controversial axiom such as the axiom of choice or the continuum hypothesis. Thus there are three possibilities. Each characterization will break some rules, uphold some others, and may be indecisive about some others.If one extends to multisets, further rules are broken (assuming Cantor\\'s approach), which hold for finite multisets. If we have two multisets A and B, A not being larger than B and B not being larger than A does not necessarily imply A has the same size as B.  This rule holds for multisets that are finite. Needless to say, the law of trichotomy is explicitly broken in this case, as opposed to the situation with sets, where it is equivalent to the axiom of choice.Dedekind simply defined an infinite set as one having the same size (in Cantor\\'s sense) as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. This definition only works in the presence of some form of the axiom of choice, however, so will not be considered to work by some mathematicians.Cantor introduced the above-mentioned cardinal numbers, and showed that (in Cantor\\'s sense) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (  0 ). Cardinality of the continuum One of Cantor\\'s most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum ( \\\\mathfrak{c} ) is greater than that of the natural numbers (  0 ); that is, there are more real numbers R than whole numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that  \\\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} > {\\\\aleph_0}  (see Cantor\\'s diagonal argument or Cantor\\'s first uncountability proof). The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,  \\\\mathfrak{c} = \\\\aleph_1 = \\\\beth_1  (see Beth one). However, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory, if ZFC is consistent.Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set S that have the same size as S, although S contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of S contain elements that are not included in it.The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−½π, ½π) and R (see also Hilbert\\'s paradox of the Grand Hotel).The second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be easily used to obtain such a proof.Cantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than  \\\\mathfrak c  exist (see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem). They include, for instance: the set of all subsets of R, i.e., the power set of R, written P(R) or 2 R  the set R R  of all functions from R to R Both have cardinality  2^\\\\mathfrak {c} = \\\\beth_2 > \\\\mathfrak c   (see Beth two). The cardinal equalities  \\\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\\\mathfrak{c},   \\\\mathfrak c^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak c,  and  \\\\mathfrak c ^{\\\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c}  can be demonstrated using cardinal arithmetic:  \\\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^2 = 2^{2\\\\times{\\\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak{c},   \\\\mathfrak c^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\aleph_0} = 2^  = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak{c},    \\\\mathfrak c ^{\\\\mathfrak c} = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c\\\\times\\\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c}.  Examples and properties If X = {a, b, c} and Y = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then |\\u2009X\\u2009| = |\\u2009Y\\u2009| because {(a, apples), (b, oranges), (c, peaches)} is a bijection between the sets X and Y. The cardinality of each of X and Y is 3. If |\\u2009X\\u2009|  \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\cup B \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert B \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\,.  From this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of unions and  intersections are related by    \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\cup D \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\cap D \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert D \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\,.

A severe blizzard has winds over  , near zero visibility, and temperatures of −12 °C (10 °F) or lower.  A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on  the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. DefinitionOfficially, the National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a severe snowstorm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities.   The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to   with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 meters or a quarter mile or less and must last for a prolonged period of time — typically three hours or more.  Blizzards     While severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may  accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring whiteout conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare. A severe blizzard has winds over  , near zero visibility, and temperatures of −12 °C (10 °F) or lower.   \"Blizzard\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online retrieved 17 March 2012   In Antarctica, blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160 km (about 100 miles) per hour. Ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface. The Australia Bureau of Meteorology describes a blizzard as, \"Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground.\"   Blizzard conditions of cold temperatures and strong winds can cause wind chill values that can result in hypothermia or frostbite.  The wind chill factor is the amount of cooling the human body feels due to the combination of wind and temperature. Blizzards in Australia Blizzards are not common in mainland Australia, but occur frequently in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Victoria. When blizzards do occur, they can affect the Tasmanian Highlands and, particularly, Mount Wellington, which towers over the Tasmanian capital Hobart. Blizzards do not affect any major towns or cities, because there are no populated areas located in the mountains except for the ski resort towns of New South Wales and Victoria. United States storm systems In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.    They are most common in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes states, and the northeastern states along the coast, and less common in the Pacific Northwest.When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, and warmer, moist air moves north from the Gulf of Mexico, all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the Texas panhandle to the Great Lakes.Another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the Hudson Bay area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and New England. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the Gulf of Mexico, strong surface winds, a lot of cold air advection, and extensive wintry precipitation occur.Low pressure systems moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the  Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and  heavy snows and strong winds to the north.  With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and whiteout conditions.  In a true whiteout there is no visible horizon.  People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only 10 feet (3 meters) away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see. Nor\\'easter blizzards A nor\\'easter  is a macro-scale storm along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada; it gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of New England and Atlantic Canada. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane. More specifically it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the East Coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast.  High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion.  Notable nor\\'easters include The Great Blizzard of 1888, one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped 40-50\\xa0inches of snow and killed 400 people, mostly in New York. Historic events 1972 Iran blizzardThe 1972 Iran Blizzard, which caused approximately 4,000 deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history.  Dropping as much as 26 feet of snow, it completely covered 200 villages.  After a snowfall lasting nearly a week, an area the size of Wisconsin was entirely buried in snow.     The Snow Winter of 1880–1881The winter of 1880-1881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in the United States.  Many children—and their parents—learned of \"The Snow Winter\" through the children\\'s book The Long Winter by Laura Ingalls Wilder, in which the author tells of her family\\'s efforts to survive.   The snow arrived in October of 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March of 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the entire winter.  Accurate details in Wilder\\'s novel include the blizzards\\' frequency and the deep cold, the Chicago and North Western Railway stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her husband Almanzo and another man, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.  The October blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows. No one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested, their grain milled, or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place. By January the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort:  As soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line, a new storm arrived, filling up the line and leaving their work useless. There were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In the towns the streets were filled  with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was resorted to to secure passage about town. Homes and  barns were completely  covered, compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock.When the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded. Massive ice jams clogged the Missouri River and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged. Most of the town of Yankton, in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks.   The Storm of the CenturyThe Storm of the Century, also known as the Great Blizzard 1993, was a large cyclonic storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15.  It is unique for its intensity, massive size and wide-reaching effect.  At its height, the storm stretched from Canada towards Central America, but its main impact was on the Eastern United States and Cuba.  The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico, and then through the Eastern United States before moving into Canada.  Areas as far south as central Alabama and Georgia received   of snow and areas such as Birmingham, Alabama, received up to   with isolated reports of  . Even the Florida Panhandle reported up to  ,    with hurricane-force wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba, hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida, which along with scattered tornadoes killed dozens of people.  Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the South and East in the wake of this storm.  In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to over 10\\xa0million customers. It is purported to have been directly experienced by nearly 40\\xa0percent of the country\\'s population at that time. A total of 310 people, including 10 from Cuba, perished during this storm.

To this day (2011), it is the worst blizzard in Chicago history. North American blizzard of 1947 was a record-breaking snowfall that began on Christmas day and brought the Northeast United States to a standstill. It  was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell steadily with drifts reaching ten feet.  Seventy-seven deaths were attributed to the blizzard.   Armistice Day Blizzard (November 12,1940) took place in the Midwest region of the United States on Armistice Day. This \"Panhandle hook\" winter storm cut a 1,000-mile-wide (1600\\xa0km) path through the middle of the country from Kansas to Michigan.  The morning of the storm was unseasonably warm but by mid afternoon conditions quickly deteriorated into a raging blizzard that would last into the next day.  A total of 145 deaths were blamed on the storm, almost a third of them duck hunters who had taken time off to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result the hunters were not dressed for cold weather.  When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the 50\\xa0mph (80\\xa0km/h) winds and 5-foot (1.5\\xa0m) waves overcame their encampments.  Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death in the single-digit temperatures that moved in over night.  Others tried to make it to shore and drowned. Great Lakes Storm of 1913 (November 7 through November 10) was the deadliest and most destructive natural disaster ever to hit the Great Lakes Basin in the Midwestern United States and the Canadian province of Ontario. Termed a \"November gale\", it produced 90\\xa0mph (145\\xa0km/h) wind gusts, waves over 35\\xa0feet (11\\xa0m) high, and whiteout snowsqualls. It killed more than 250 people,destroyed 19 ships, and stranded 19 others. Perhaps the most well-known ship to go down in a November gale was the SS Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975.  Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888, North American Great Plains.  What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people—including many schoolchildren—got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235.  Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster.

The city had been the administrative centre of the Chernobyl Raion since 1932.The city was evacuated in 1986 due to the Chernobyl disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located   north-northwest. The power plant was within Chernobyl Raion (District), but the city was not the residence of the power plant workers. When the power plant was under construction, Prypiat, a city larger and closer to the power plant, had been built as home for the power plant workers.After the accident the Chernobyl Raion administration was transferred to the neighboring Ivankiv Raion. Though the city today is mostly uninhabited, a small number of people reside in houses marked with signs stating that the \"Owner of this house lives here\". Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the Zone of Alienation are stationed in the city on a long term basis. Prior to its evacuation, the city was inhabited by about 14,000 residents.  The city of Slavutych was built specifically for the evacuated population of Chernobyl. Name originThe city name is the same as a local Ukrainian name for Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort or common wormwood), which is also чорнобиль \"chornobyl\".  An alternative etymology holds that it is a combination of the words chornyi (чорний, black) and byllia (билля, grass blades or stalks), hence it would literally mean black grass or black stalks. HistoryOriginally part of the land of Kievan Rus Chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193, described as a hunting-lodge of Knyaz Rostislavich. Norman Davies, Europe: A History, Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-19-820171-0   It was a crown village of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. The village was granted as a fiefdom to Filon Kmita, a captain of the royal cavalry, in 1566. The province containing Chernobyl was transferred to the Kingdom of Poland in 1569, and then annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. Davies, Norman (1995) \"Chernobyl\", The Sarmatian Review, vol. 15, No. 1.  Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by Ukrainian and some Polish peasants, and a relatively large number of Jews.Chernobyl had a rich religious history. The Jews were brought by Filon Kmita, during the Polish campaign of colonization. The traditionally Christian Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian peasantry of the district was largely forced, by Poland, to convert to the Greek Catholic Uniate religion after 1596. Yet the vast majority returned to Eastern Orthodoxy after the Partitions of Poland.The Dominican church and monastery were founded in 1626 by Lukasz Sapieha, at the height of the Counter-reformation. There was a group of Old Catholics, who opposed the decrees of the Council of Trent. The Dominican monastery was sequestrated in 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, and the church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852. In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became one of the major centers of Hasidic Judaism. The Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty had been founded by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky. The Jewish population suffered greatly from pogroms in October 1905 and in March–April 1919, when many Jews were killed and others were robbed, at the instigation of the Russian nationalist Black Hundreds. In 1920, the Twersky dynasty left Chernobyl, and it ceased to exist as a Hasidic centre.Since the 1880s, Chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune. In 1898 Chernobyl had a population of 10,800, including 7,200 Jews. In World War I the village was occupied, and in the ensuing Civil War, Chernobyl was fought over by Bolsheviks and Ukrainians. In the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–20, it was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the Red Army. From 1921, it was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. During the period 1929–33, Chernobyl suffered greatly from mass killings during Stalin\\'s collectivization campaign, and in the Holodomor (famine) that followed. The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936 during the Frontier Clearances. The Jewish community was murdered during the German occupation of 1941–44.  Twenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station on Ukrainian soil.The Duga-3 over-the-horizon radar array several miles out of Chernobyl was the origin of the infamous Russian Woodpecker, designed as part of Russia\\'s anti-ballistic missile early warning radar network.With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of Ukraine, now an independent nation.A small number of people continue to live in Chernobyl, having refused to leave their native city after the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986. Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster   On April 26, 1986, Reactor #4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the town of Pripyat, Ukraine, exploded. The explosion took place at 1:23am while the neighboring town of Pripyat slept. Two workers were killed instantly. 40 hours later, the residents of Pripyat were ordered to evacuate, and most never returned; by that time, many of the residents had suffered varying degrees of radiation poisoning.In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched a project called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas.  The program launched its activities based on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations and was initiated in February 2002. The main goal of the CRDP\\'s activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine to mitigate long-term social, economic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, among others. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kiev Oblast, Zhytomyrska Oblast, partially Kiev, Chernihivska Oblast and Rivne Oblast. Chernobylite  Chernobylite is the name cited by two media sources   for highly radioactive, unusual and potentially novel crystalline formations found at the Chernobyl power plant after the explosion. These formations were found in the basement below Reactor #4 during an investigation into missing reactor fuel.

It was originally released in 1996. ArchitectureThe 6x86 is superscalar and superpipelined and performs register renaming, speculative execution, out-of-order execution, and data dependency removal. However, it continued to use native x86 execution and ordinary microcode only, like Centaur\\'s Winchip, unlike competitors Intel and AMD which introduced the method of dynamic translation to micro-operations with Pentium Pro and K5.With regard to internal caches, it has a 16-kB primary cache and is socket-compatible with the Intel P54C Pentium. It was also unique in that it was the only x86 design to incorporate a 256-byte Level 0 scratchpad cache. It has six performance levels: PR 90+, PR 120+, PR 133+, PR 150+, PR 166+ and PR 200+. These performance levels do not map to the clock speed of the chip itself (for example, a PR 133+ ran at 110\\xa0MHz, a PR 166+ ran at 133\\xa0MHz, etc.).The 6x86 and 6x86L weren\\'t completely compatible with the Intel P5 Pentium instruction set and is not multi-processor capable. For this reason, the chip identified itself as a 80486 and disabled the CPUID instruction by default. CPUID support could be enabled by first enabling extended CCR registers then setting bit 7 in CCR4. The lack of full P5 Pentium compatibility caused problems with some applications because programmers had begun to use P5 Pentium-specific instructions. Some companies released patches for their products to make them function on the 6x86.The first generation of 6x86 had heat problems. This was primarily caused by their higher heat output than other x86 CPUs of the day and, as such, computer builders sometimes did not equip them with adequate cooling. The CPUs topped out at around 25\\xa0W heat output (like the AMD K6), whereas the P5 Pentium produced around 15\\xa0W of waste heat at its peak. However, both numbers would be a fraction of the heat generated by many high performance processors, some years later. Revised cores The 6x86L (codename M1L) was later released by Cyrix to address heat issues; the L standing for low-power. Improved manufacturing technologies permitted usage of a lower Vcore. Just like the Pentium MMX the 6x86L required a split powerplane voltage regulator with separate voltages for I/O and CPU core. Another release of the 6x86, the 6x86MX, added MMX compatibility, introduced the EMMI instruction set, and quadrupled the primary cache size to 64\\xa0KB. Later revisions of this chip were renamed  MII, to better compete with the Pentium II processor. Performance It has been speculated by experts  that 6x86 was designed to perform well specifically on business-oriented benchmarks of the time, most notably Ziff-Davis\\' Winstone benchmark.  Winstone ran various speed tests using several popular applications. It was one of the leading benchmarks during the mid-\\'90s and was used in some leading magazines, such as Computer Shopper  and PC Magazine, as a deciding factor for system ratings.Cyrix used a PR rating (Performance Rating) to relate their performance to the Intel P5 Pentium (pre-P55C), because a 6x86 at a lower clock rate outperformed the higher-clocked P5 Pentium. For example, a 133\\xa0MHz 6x86 will outperform a P5 Pentium at 166\\xa0MHz, and as a result Cyrix could market the 133\\xa0MHz chip as being a P5 Pentium 166\\'s equal. A PR rating was also necessary because the 6x86 could not clock as high as P5 Pentium and maintain equivalent manufacturing yields, so it was critical to establish the slower clock speeds as equal in the minds of the consumer. However, the PR rating was not an entirely truthful representation of the 6x86\\'s performance.While the 6x86\\'s integer performance was significantly higher than P5 Pentium\\'s, its floating point performance was more mediocre—between 2 and 4 times the performance of the 486 FPU per clock cycle(depending on the operation and precision). The FPU in the 6x86 was largely the same circuitry that was developed for Cyrix\\'s earlier high performance 8087/80287/80387-compatible coprocessors, which was very fast for its time—the Cyrix FPU was much faster than the 80387, and even the 80486 FPU. However, it was still considerably slower than the new and completely redesigned P5 Pentium and P6 Pentium Pro-Pentium III FPUs. During the 6x86\\'s development, the majority of applications (office software as well as games) performed almost entirely integer operations. The designers foresaw that future applications would most likely maintain this instruction focus. So, to optimize the chip\\'s performance for what they believed to be the most likely application of the CPU, the integer execution resources received most of the transistor budget.The popularity of the P5 Pentium caused many software developers to hand-optimize code in assembly language, to take advantage of the P5 Pentium\\'s tightly pipelined and lower latency FPU. For example, the highly anticipated first person shooter Quake used highly-optimized assembly code designed almost entirely around the P5 Pentium\\'s FPU. As a result, the P5 Pentium significantly outperformed other CPUs in the game. Fortunately for the 6x86 (and AMD K6), many games continued to be integer-based throughout the chip\\'s lifetime. Cyrix MIIThe 6x86 successor—MII—was late to market, and couldn\\'t scale well in clock speed with the manufacturing processes used at the time. Similar to the AMD K5, the Cyrix 6x86 was a design far more focused on integer per-clock performance than clock scalability, something that proved to be a strategic mistake. Therefore, despite being very fast clock by clock, the 6x86 and MII were forced to compete at the low-end of the market as AMD K6 and Intel P6 Pentium II were always ahead on clock speed. The 6x86\\'s and MII\\'s old generation \"486 class\" floating point unit combined with an integer section that was at best on-par with the newer P6 and K6 chips meant that Cyrix could no longer compete in performance.

Bessel functions are also known as cylinder functions or cylindrical harmonics because they are found in the solution to Laplace\\'s equation in cylindrical coordinates. Applications of Bessel functionsBessel\\'s equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace\\'s equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (α = n); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (α = n+1/2). For example: Electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguide Heat conduction in a cylindrical object Modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) artificial membrane (such as a drum or other membranophone) Diffusion problems on a lattice Solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation (in spherical and cylindrical coordinates) for a free particle Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation Frequency-dependent friction in circular pipelines Bessel functions also have useful properties for other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see FM synthesis, Kaiser window, or Bessel filter). DefinitionsSince this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two linearly independent solutions.  Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient, and the different variations are described below. Bessel functions of the first kind : J α Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as J α (x), are solutions of Bessel\\'s differential equation that are finite at the origin\\xa0(x\\xa0=\\xa00) for integer or positive α, and diverge as x approaches zero for negative non-integer\\xa0α. It is possible to define the function by its Taylor series expansion around x\\xa0=\\xa00:    J_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\\\, \\\\Gamma(m+\\\\alpha+1)} {\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)}^{2m+\\\\alpha}   where Γ(z) is the gamma function, a shifted generalization of the factorial function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an entire function if α is an integer. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√x (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large x. (The Taylor series indicates that −J 1 (x) is the derivative of J 0 (x), much like −sin(x) is the derivative of cos(x); more generally, the derivative of J n (x) can be expressed in terms of J n±1 (x) by the identities below.)For non-integer α, the functions J α (x) and J −α (x) are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order α, the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):   J_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_{n}(x).\\\\,  This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below. Bessel\\'s integralsAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of n, is possible using an integral representation:  J_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\cos (n \\\\tau - x \\\\sin(\\\\tau)) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau.  Another integral representation is:  J_n (x) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi e^{-i(n \\\\tau - x \\\\sin(\\\\tau))} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau.  This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by (for Re(x) > 0)  J_\\\\alpha(x) =   \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\tau- x \\\\sin\\\\tau)\\\\,d\\\\tau - \\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty  e^{-x \\\\sinh(t) - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt.        Relation to hypergeometric seriesThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric series as   J_\\\\alpha(x)=\\\\frac{(\\\\frac{x}{2})^\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)}  \\\\;_0F_1 (\\\\alpha+1; -\\\\tfrac{x^2}{4}).  This expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the Bessel–Clifford function. Relation to Laguerre polynomialsIn terms of the Laguerre polynomials L k  and arbitrarily chosen parameter t, the Bessel function can be expressed as   \\\\frac{J_\\\\alpha(x)}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha}= \\\\frac{e^{-t}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)} \\\\sum_{k=0} \\\\frac{L_k^{(\\\\alpha)}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^2}{4 t}\\\\right)}  \\\\frac{t^k}{k!}.  Bessel functions of the second kind : Y α The Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by Y α (x), occasionally denoted instead by N α (x), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation that have a singularity at the origin (x = 0).  These are sometimes called Weber functions after Heinrich Martin Weber, and also Neumann functions after Carl Neumann.For non-integer α, Y α (x) is related to J α (x) by:  Y_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{J_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\pi) - J_{-\\\\alpha}(x)}{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}.  In the case of integer order n, the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer α tends to n:  Y_n(x) = \\\\lim_{\\\\alpha \\\\to n} Y_\\\\alpha(x).  There is also a corresponding integral formula (for Re(x) > 0),   Y_n(x) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin(x \\\\sin\\\\theta - n\\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty  \\\\left[ e^{n t} + (-1)^n e^{-n t} \\\\right]  e^{-x \\\\sinh t} \\\\, dt.   Y α (x) is necessary as the second linearly independent solution of the Bessel\\'s equation when α is an integer. But Y α (x) has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a \\'natural\\' partner of J α (x). See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.When α is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:  Y_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\\\\,  Both J α (x) and Y α (x) are holomorphic functions of x on  the complex plane cut along the negative real axis.  When α is an integer, the Bessel functions J are entire functions of x.  If x is held fixed, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of α. Hankel functions: H α  (1) , H α  (2) Another important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel\\'s equation are the Hankel functions H α  (1) (x) and H α  (2) (x), defined by:   H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(x) = J_\\\\alpha(x) + i Y_\\\\alpha(x)   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(x) = J_\\\\alpha(x) - i Y_\\\\alpha(x)  where i is the imaginary unit. These linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel\\'s differential equation. They are named after Hermann Hankel.The importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, \\'simple\\' means  an appearance of the factor of the form e if(x) . The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.The Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the sign convention for the frequency).Using the previous relationships they can be expressed as:  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x) = \\\\frac{J_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} J_\\\\alpha (x)}{i \\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)}   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x) = \\\\frac{J_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - e^{\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} J_\\\\alpha (x)}{- i \\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)}.  If α is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether α is an integer or not:   H_{-\\\\alpha}^{(1)} (x)= e^{\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x)    H_{-\\\\alpha}^{(2)} (x)= e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x).   In particular, if α = m + 1/2 with m a nonnegative integer, the above relations imply directly that  J_{-(m+\\\\frac{1}{2})}(x) = (-1)^{m+1} Y_{m+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)    Y_{-(m+\\\\frac{1}{2})}(x) = (-1)^m J_{m+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x).   These are useful in developing the spherical Bessel functions (below).The Hankel functions admit the following integral representations for Re(x) > 0:   H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty+i\\\\pi} e^{x\\\\sinh t - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt,    H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x)= -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty-i\\\\pi} e^{x\\\\sinh t - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt,   where the integration limits indicate integration along a contour that can be chosen as follows: from −∞ to 0 along the negative real axis, from 0 to ±iπ along the imaginary axis, and from ±iπ to +∞±iπ along a contour parallel to the real axis. ===Modified Bessel functions : I α , K α ===  The Bessel functions are valid even for complex arguments x, and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument.  In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the modified Bessel functions (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind, and are defined by any of these equivalent alternatives:   I_\\\\alpha(x) = i^{-\\\\alpha} J_\\\\alpha(ix) =\\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{m! \\\\Gamma(m+\\\\alpha+1)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)^{2m+\\\\alpha}   K_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\frac{I_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - I_\\\\alpha (x)}{\\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} i^{\\\\alpha+1} H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(ix) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} (-i)^{\\\\alpha+1} H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(-ix).  These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments x. The series expansion for I α (x) is thus similar to that for J α (x), but without the alternating (−1) m  factor.We can express the first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions (these are valid if −π  \\\\begin{align} J_\\\\alpha(iz) &=e^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha i\\\\pi}{2}} I_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\\\\\ Y_\\\\alpha(iz) &=e^{\\\\frac{(\\\\alpha+1)i\\\\pi}{2}}I_\\\\alpha(z)-\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha i\\\\pi}{2}}K_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\end{align} I α (x) and K α (x) are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel\\'s equation:   x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} - (x^2 + \\\\alpha^2)y = 0.  Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument, I α  and K α  are exponentially growing and decaying functions, respectively.  Like the ordinary Bessel function J α , the function I α  goes to zero at x = 0 for α > 0 and is finite at x = 0 for α = 0.  Analogously, K α  diverges at x\\xa0=\\xa00.     Two integral formulas for the modified Bessel functions are (for Re(x) > 0):   I_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\exp(x\\\\cos(\\\\theta)) \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\theta) d\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp(-x\\\\cosh t - \\\\alpha t) dt ,   K_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp(-x\\\\cosh t) \\\\cosh(\\\\alpha t) dt.  Modified Bessel functions K 1/3  and K 2/3  can be represented in terms of rapidly converged integrals    \\\\begin{align} K_{\\\\frac{1}{3}} (\\\\xi) &= \\\\sqrt{3}\\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\, \\\\exp \\\\left[- \\\\xi \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4x^2}{3}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}} \\\\right] \\\\ dx \\\\\\\\ K_{\\\\frac{2}{3}} (\\\\xi) &= \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\, \\\\frac{3+2x^2}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}}} \\\\exp  \\\\left[- \\\\xi  \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4x^2}{3}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}} \\\\right] \\\\ dx \\\\end{align} The modified Bessel function of the second kind has also been called by the now-rare names: Basset function after Alfred Barnard Basset Modified Bessel function of the third kind Modified Hankel function  Macdonald function after Hector Munro Macdonald Weber function    Neumann function  Spherical Bessel functions: j n , y n  When solving the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates by separation of variables, the radial equation has the form:  x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + [x^2 - n(n+1)]y = 0.  The two linearly independent solutions to this equation are called the spherical Bessel functions j n  and y n , and are related to the ordinary Bessel functions  J n  and Y n  by:   j_{n}(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} J_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x),   y_{n}(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} Y_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x) = (-1)^{n+1} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} J_{-n-\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x).  y n  is also denoted n n  or η n ; some authors call these functions the spherical Neumann functions.The spherical Bessel functions can also be written as (Rayleigh\\'s Formulas):   j_n(x) = (-x)^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} ,   y_n(x) = -(-x)^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}.  The first spherical Bessel function j 0 (x) is also known as the (unnormalized) sinc function. The first few spherical Bessel functions are:  j_0(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x}   j_1(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x^2}- \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x}   j_2(x)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{3} {x^2} - 1 \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} - \\\\frac{3\\\\cos(x)} {x^2}    j_3(x)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{15}{x^3} - \\\\frac{6}{x} \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} -\\\\left(\\\\frac{15}{x^2} - 1\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x},  and  y_0(x)=-j_{-1}(x)=-\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x}   y_1(x)=j_{-2}(x)=-\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x^2}- \\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x}   y_2(x)=-j_{-3}(x)=\\\\left(-\\\\,\\\\frac{3}{x^2}+1 \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}- \\\\frac{3\\\\sin(x)} {x^2}    y_{3}\\\\left( x\\\\right)=j_{-4}(x) =\\\\left( -\\\\frac{15}{x^{3}}+\\\\frac{6}{x}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}-\\\\left( \\\\frac{15}{x^{2}}-1\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x}.  Generating functionThe spherical Bessel functions have the generating functions    \\\\frac 1 {z} \\\\cos \\\\left (\\\\sqrt{z^2 - 2zt} \\\\right )= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^n}{n!} j_{n-1}(z),    \\\\frac 1 {z} \\\\sin \\\\left ( \\\\sqrt{z^2 + 2zt} \\\\right )= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-t)^n}{n!} y_{n-1}(z) .  Differential relationsIn the following f n  is any of  j_n, y_n, h_n^{(1)}, h_n^{(2)}  for  n=0,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 2,\\\\dots   \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\right)^m\\\\left(z^{n+1}f_n(z)\\\\right)=z^{(n-m)+1}f_{(n-m)}(z).   Spherical Hankel functions: h n  (1) , h n  (2) There are also spherical analogues of the Hankel functions:  h_n^{(1)}(x) = j_n(x) + i y_n(x) \\\\,    h_n^{(2)}(x) = j_n(x) - i y_n(x). \\\\,   In fact, there are simple closed-form expressions for the Bessel functions of half-integer order in terms of the standard trigonometric functions, and therefore for the spherical Bessel functions.  In particular, for non-negative integers n:  h_n^{(1)}(x) = (-i)^{n+1} \\\\frac{e^{ix}}{x} \\\\sum_{m=0}^n \\\\frac{i^m}{m!(2x)^m} \\\\frac{(n+m)!}{(n-m)!}  and  h_n^{(2)}  is the complex-conjugate of this (for real x). It follows, for example, that  j_0(x) = \\\\sin(x)/x  and  y_0(x) = -\\\\cos(x)/x , and so on.The spherical Hankel functions appear in problems involving spherical wave propagation, for example in the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field. Riccati–Bessel functions: S n , C n , ξ n , ζ n Riccati–Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:  S_n(x)=x j_n(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, J_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)   C_n(x)=-x y_n(x)=-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, Y_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)   \\\\xi_n(x) = x h_n^{(1)}(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, H_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}^{(1)}(x)=S_n(x)-iC_n(x)   \\\\zeta_n(x)=x h_n^{(2)}(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, H_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}^{(2)}(x)=S_n(x)+iC_n(x).  They satisfy the differential equation:  x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + [x^2 - n (n+1)] y = 0.  This differential equation, and the Riccati–Bessel solutions, arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as Mie scattering after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004)  for recent developments and references.Following Debye (1909), the notation  \\\\psi_n,\\\\chi_n  is sometimes used instead of  S_n,C_n . Asymptotic formsThe Bessel functions have the following asymptotic forms for non-negative α.  For small arguments  0  , one obtains: Arfken & Weber.   J_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{z}{2} \\\\right) ^\\\\alpha    Y_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\begin{cases}  \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\left[ \\\\ln (z/2) + \\\\gamma \\\\right]  & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha=0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\   -\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\pi} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{z} \\\\right) ^\\\\alpha & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\end{cases}   where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant (0.5772...) and Γ denotes the gamma function. For large real arguments  x \\\\gg |\\\\alpha^2 - 1/4| , one cannot write a true asymptotic form for Bessel functions of the first and second kind (unless α is half-integer) because they have zeros all the way out to infinity which would have to be matched exactly by any asymptotic expansion. However, for a given value of arg(z) one can write an equation containing a term of order |z| −1 :   J_\\\\alpha(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\left(\\\\cos \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)+e^{|\\\\operatorname{Im}(z)|}O(|z|^{-1})\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }|\\\\arg z|   Y_\\\\alpha(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\left(\\\\sin \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)+e^{|\\\\operatorname{Im}(z)|}O(|z|^{-1})\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }|\\\\arg z|  (For α = 1/2 the last terms in these formulas drop out completely; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Even though these equations are true, better approximations may be available for complex z. For example, J 0 (z) when z is near the negative real line is approximated better by  J_0(z)\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\cos \\\\left(z+\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)  than by  J_0(z)\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\cos \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right) .The asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions are:  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(z)\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\exp\\\\left(i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(z)\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }-2\\\\pi  These can be extended to other values of arg(z) using equations relating  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(ze^{im\\\\pi})  and  H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(ze^{im\\\\pi})  to H α  (1) (z) and H α  (2) (z).  It is interesting that although the Bessel function of the first kind is the average of the two Hankel functions, J α (z) is not asymptotic to the average of these two asymptotic forms when z is negative (because one or the other will not be correct there, depending on the arg(z) used). But the asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions permit us to write asymptotic forms for the Bessel functions of first and second kinds for complex (non-real) z so long as |z| goes to infinity at a constant phase angle arg z (using the square root having positive real part):  J_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left( i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   J_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }0   Y_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim-i\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left( i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   Y_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim-i\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }0  For the modified Bessel functions, Hankel developed asymptotic expansions as well:  I_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\frac{e^z}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 1}{8 z} + \\\\frac{(4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 1) (4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 9)}{2!

A. Hansen in 1843.  (This can be generalized to non-integer order by contour integration or other methods.)  Another important relation for integer orders is the Jacobi–Anger expansion:  e^{iz \\\\cos(\\\\phi)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty i^n J_n(z) e^{in\\\\phi},\\\\!  and  e^{iz \\\\sin(\\\\phi)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty J_n(z) e^{in\\\\phi},\\\\!  which is used to expand a plane wave as a sum of cylindrical waves, or to find the Fourier series of a tone-modulated FM signal.More generally, a series  f(z)=a_0^\\\\nu J_\\\\nu (z)+ 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{k=1} a_k^\\\\nu J_{\\\\nu+k}(z)\\\\!  is called Neumann expansion of ƒ. The coefficients for ν = 0 have the explicit form  a_k^0=\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_{|z|=c} f(z) O_k(z) \\\\, \\\\mathrm d z,\\\\!  where O k  is Neumann\\'s polynomial. Selected functions admit the special representation  f(z)=\\\\sum_{k=0} a_k^\\\\nu J_{\\\\nu+2k}(z)\\\\!  with  a_k^\\\\nu=2(\\\\nu+2k) \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(z) \\\\frac{J_{\\\\nu+2k}(z)}z  \\\\mathrm d z\\\\!  due to the orthogonality relation   \\\\int_0^\\\\infty J_\\\\alpha(z) J_\\\\beta(z) \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm d z} z= \\\\frac 2 \\\\pi \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\pi 2 (\\\\alpha-\\\\beta)  \\\\right)}{\\\\alpha^2 -\\\\beta^2}.  More generally, if ƒ has a branch-point near the origin of such a nature that   f(z)= \\\\sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\\\\nu+k}(z),   then  \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\left\\\\{\\\\sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\\\\nu+k} \\\\right\\\\}(s)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+s^2}} \\\\sum_{k=0} \\\\frac{a_k}{(s+\\\\sqrt{1+s^2})^{\\\\nu+k}}  or  \\\\sum_{k=0} a_k \\\\xi^{\\\\nu+k}= \\\\frac{1+\\\\xi^2}{2\\\\xi} \\\\mathcal L \\\\{f \\\\} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1-\\\\xi^2}{2\\\\xi} \\\\right),  where  \\\\mathcal L \\\\{f \\\\}  is f \\' s Laplace transform. Another way to define the Bessel functions is the Poisson representation formula and the Mehler-Sonine formula:  \\\\begin{align}J_\\\\nu(z) &= \\\\frac{ (\\\\frac{z}{2})^\\\\nu }{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\nu + \\\\frac{1}{2} ) \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} } \\\\int_{-1}^{1} e^{izs}(1 - s^2)^{\\\\nu - \\\\frac{1}{2} } ds, \\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac 2  d u,\\\\end{align}  where ν > −1/2 and z ∈ C.  This formula is useful especially when working with Fourier transforms.The functions J α , Y α , H α  (1) , and H α  (2)  all satisfy the recurrence relations:  \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{x} Z_\\\\alpha(x) = Z_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) + Z_{\\\\alpha+1}(x)\\\\!    2\\\\frac{dZ_\\\\alpha}{dx} = Z_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) - Z_{\\\\alpha+1}(x)\\\\!  where Z denotes J, Y, H (1) , or H (2) .  (These two identities are often combined, e.g. added or subtracted, to yield various other relations.) In this way, for example, one can compute Bessel functions of higher orders (or higher derivatives) given the values at lower orders (or lower derivatives).  In particular, it follows that:  \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{x dx} \\\\right)^m \\\\left[ x^\\\\alpha Z_{\\\\alpha} (x) \\\\right] = x^{\\\\alpha - m} Z_{\\\\alpha - m} (x)   \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{x dx} \\\\right)^m \\\\left[ \\\\frac{Z_\\\\alpha (x)}{x^\\\\alpha} \\\\right] = (-1)^m \\\\frac{Z_{\\\\alpha + m} (x)}{x^{\\\\alpha + m}}.  Modified Bessel functions follow similar relations :  e^{(\\\\frac{x}{2})(t+1/t)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I_n(x) t^n,\\\\!  and  e^{z \\\\cos( \\\\theta)} = I_0(z) + 2\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty  I_n(z) \\\\cos(n\\\\theta).\\\\!  The recurrence relation reads  C_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) - C_{\\\\alpha+1}(x) = \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{x} C_\\\\alpha(x)\\\\!   C_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) + C_{\\\\alpha+1}(x) = 2\\\\frac{dC_\\\\alpha}{dx}\\\\!  where C α  denotes I α  or e απi K α . These recurrence relations are useful for discrete diffusion problems.Because Bessel\\'s equation becomes Hermitian (self-adjoint) if it is divided by x, the solutions must satisfy an orthogonality relationship for appropriate boundary conditions.  In particular, it follows that:  \\\\int_0^1 x J_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,m}) J_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,n}) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\\\\alpha+1}(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\\\\alpha}\\'(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2,\\\\!  where α > −1, δ m,n  is the Kronecker delta, and u α, m  is the m-th zero of J α (x).  This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the Fourier–Bessel series, where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions J α (x u α, m ) for fixed α and varying m.An analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately:  \\\\int_0^1 x^2 j_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,m}) j_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,n}) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [j_{\\\\alpha+1}(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2.\\\\!  Another orthogonality relation is the closure equation:   \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x J_\\\\alpha(ux) J_\\\\alpha(vx) dx = \\\\frac{1}{u} \\\\delta(u - v)\\\\!  for α > −1/2 and where δ is the Dirac delta function. This property is used to construct an arbitrary function from a series of Bessel functions by means of the Hankel transform. For the spherical Bessel functions the orthogonality relation is:  \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^2 j_\\\\alpha(ux) j_\\\\alpha(vx) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2u^2} \\\\delta(u - v)\\\\!  for α > −1.Another important property of Bessel\\'s equations, which follows from Abel\\'s identity, involves the Wronskian of the solutions:  A_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\frac{dB_\\\\alpha}{dx} - \\\\frac{dA_\\\\alpha}{dx} B_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{C_\\\\alpha}{x},\\\\!  where A α  and B α  are any two solutions of Bessel\\'s equation, and C α  is a constant independent of x (which depends on α and on the particular Bessel functions considered).  For example, if A α  = J α  and B α  = Y α , then C α  is 2/π.  This also holds for the modified Bessel functions; for example, if A α  = I α  and B α  = K α , then C α  is −1.(There are a large number of other known integrals and identities that are not reproduced here, but which can be found in the references.) Multiplication theoremThe Bessel functions obey a multiplication theorem  \\\\lambda^{-\\\\nu} J_\\\\nu (\\\\lambda z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{(1-\\\\lambda^2)z}{2}\\\\right)^n J_{\\\\nu+n}(z)   where λ and ν may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers. A similar form may be given for Y ν (z) and so on.   Bourget\\'s hypothesisBessel himself originally proved that for non-negative integers n, the equation J n (x) = 0 has an infinite number of solutions in x.   When the functions J n (x) are plotted on the same graph, though, none of the zeros seem to coincide for different values of n except for the zero at x = 0.  This phenomenon is known as Bourget\\'s hypothesis after the nineteenth century French mathematician who studied Bessel functions.  Specifically it states that for any integers n ≥ 0 and m ≥ 1, the functions J n (x) and J n+m (x) have no common zeros other than the one at x = 0.  The hypothesis was proved by Carl Ludwig Siegel in 1929.

A consumer may be a person or group, such as a household.  The concept of a consumer may vary significantly by context, although a common definition is an individual who buys products or services for personal use and not for manufacture or resale. Economics and marketingThe consumer is the one who pays to consume the goods and services produced. As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. In the absence of effective consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers. Typically, when business people and economists talk of consumers, they are talking about the person as consumer, an aggregated commodity item with little individuality other than that expressed in the decision to buy or not to buy. However, there is a trend in marketing to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad demographic profiles and psycho-graphic profiles of market segments, marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing, permission marketing, and mass customization.      Law and politicsThe law primarily uses the notion of the consumer in relation to consumer protection laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users.   A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business.   As of all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection takes on a clear political significance.Concern over the interests of consumers has also spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer education into school curricula.  There are also various non-profit publications, such as Consumer Reports and Choice Magazine, dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making, and Which? in the UK.In India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 clearly differentiates a consumer as consuming a commodity or service either for his personal domestic use or to earn his livelihood. Only consumers are protected as per this act and any person, entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act.     Furthermore, Indian case law has quite a few references on how to distinguish a consumer from a customer.  Public reactionWhile use of the term consumer is widespread among governmental, business and media organisations, many individuals and groups find the label objectionable because it assigns a limited and passive role to their activities.

    "document_3 = '740\\tAllah\\tAllah (  or  ;    ,  ,  ) is the Arabic word for God (literally \"the God\", as the initial \"Al-\" is the definite article).    It is used mainly by Muslims to refer to the Islamic God,  Arab Christians, and often, albeit not exclusively, by Bahá\\'ís, Arabic-speakers, Indonesian, Malaysian and Maltese Christians, and Mizrahi Jews.  \"Allah.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica  Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, Allah  Columbia Encyclopedia, Allah  Etymology The term Allāh is derived from a contraction of the Arabic definite article al- \"the\" and   \"deity, god\" to   meaning \"the [sole] deity, God\" ( , ho theos monos). L. Gardet, Allah, Encyclopaedia of Islam  Cognates of the name \"Allāh\" exist in other Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic. Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite El, the Mesopotamian ilu, and the biblical Elohim and Eloah, the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists.  Biblical Hebrew mostly uses the plural form (but functional singular) Elohim. The corresponding Aramaic form is     in Biblical Aramaic and      in Syriac as used by the Assyrian Church, both meaning simply \"God\". The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon – Entry for    In the Sikh scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib, the term Allah ( ) is used 37 times. Guru Granth Sahib website (Search: ਅਲਹ|ਅਲਾਹ)  The name was previously  used by pagan Meccans as a reference to a creator deity, possibly the supreme deity in pre-Islamic Arabia. L. Gardet, \"Allah\", Encyclopedia of Islam     The concepts associated with the term Allah (as a deity) differ among religious traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, Allah was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters–a concept that was deleted under the process of Islamization. In Islam, the name Allah is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name, and all other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah.     Allah is unique, the only Deity, creator of the universe and omnipotent.   Arab Christians today use terms such as   ( , \"God the Father\") to distinguish their usage from Muslim usage.     There are both similarities and differences between the concept of God as portrayed in the Qur\\'an and the Hebrew Bible.  It has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept.  Unicode has a codepoint reserved for Allāh,   = U+FDF2. Unicode Standard 5.0, p.479,492  Many Arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for Allah.  Arabic fonts and Mac OS X Programs for Arabic in Mac OS X  Usage in Arabic Pre-Islamic ArabiaIn pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was used by Meccans as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity.  Allah was not considered the sole divinity; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion.  Allah was associated with companions, whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities. Meccans held that a kind of kinship existed between Allah and the jinn.  Allah was thought to have had sons  and that the local deities of  , Manāt and al-Lāt were His daughters.  The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah.   Allah was invoked in times of distress. Gerhard Böwering, God and his Attributes, Encyclopedia of the Qur\\'an   Muhammad\\'s father\\'s name was   meaning \"the slave of Allāh\".  Islam    According to Islamic belief, Allah is the proper name of God, Böwering, Gerhard, God and His Attributes, Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.  and humble submission to His Will, Divine Ordinances and Commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith.  \"He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.\" Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, Allah   \"He is unique ( ) and inherently one ( ), all-merciful and omnipotent.\"  The Qur\\'an declares \"the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.\"  In Islamic tradition, there are 99 Names of God (  lit. meaning: \"The best names\") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah.     All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.  Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are \"the Merciful\" (ar-raḥmān) and \"the Compassionate\" ( ).  Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase   (meaning \"God willing\") after references to future events.  Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of   (meaning \"In the name of God\"). There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including \"Subhan-Allah\" (Holiness be to God), \"Alhamdulillah\" (Praise be to God),   (There is no deity but God) and \"Allāhu Akbar\" (God is great) as a devotional exercise of remembering God (zikr).  In a Sufi practice known as zikr Allah (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name Allah or other divine names while controlling his or her breath. Some scholars  have suggested that Muhammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful.  According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between God and jinn.  Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edwards Peters, \"The Qur\\'an insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ( ). The Koran\\'s Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". Peters states that the Qur\\'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows Israelites. F.E. Peters, Islam, p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003  ChristianityThe Aramaic word for \"God\" in the language of Assyrian Christians is  , or Alaha. Arabic-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word \"Allah\" to mean \"God\".  The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for \"God\" than \"Allah\".  (Even the Arabic-descended Maltese language of Malta, whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses Alla for \"God\".) Arab Christians for example use terms   ( ) meaning God the Father,   ( ) mean God the Son, and   ( ) meaning God the Holy Spirit. (See God in Christianity for the Christian concept of God.)Arab Christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim  , and also created their own Trinitized   as early as the 8th century CE.  The Muslim   reads: \"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\" The Trinitized   reads: \"In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.\" The Syriac, Latin and Greek invocations do not have the words \"One God\" at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims. Thomas E. Burman, Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs, Brill, 1994, p. 103 According to Marshall Hodgson, it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.  Judaism As Hebrew and Arabic are closely related Semitic languages, it is commonly accepted that Allah (root,  ) and the Biblical Elohim are cognate derivations of same origin, as in Eloah a Hebrew word which is used (e.g. in the Book of Job) to mean \"(the) God\" and also \"god or gods\" as in the case of Elohim, ultimately deriving from the root El, \"strong\", possibly genericized from El (deity), as in the Ugaritic lhm \"children of El\" (the ancient Near Eastern creator god in pre-Abrahamic tradition).In Jewish scripture Elohim is used as a descriptive title for the God of the scriptures whose name is YHWH, as well as for pagan gods. As a loanword English and other European languages  The history of the word \"Allāh\" in English was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century; for example, Thomas Carlyle (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), Tor Andræ always used the term Allah, though he allows that this \"conception of God\" seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies. William Montgomery Watt, Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue, Routledge, 1983, p.45 Languages which may not commonly use the term Allah to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, the word ojalá in the Spanish language and oxalá in the Portuguese language exist today, borrowed from Arabic (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means \"God willing\" (in the sense of \"I hope so\").  The German poet Mahlmann used the form \"Allah\" as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity, though it is unclear how much Islamic thought he intended to convey.  Some Muslims leave the name \"Allāh\" untranslated in English.  Malaysian and Indonesian languageChristians in Indonesia and Malaysia also use Allah to refer to God in the Malaysian language and Indonesian language (both languages forms of the Malay language which is referred to as Bahasa Melayu).Mainstream Bible translations  in both languages use Allah as the translation of Hebrew Elohim (translated in English Bibles as \"God\").  This goes back to early translation work by Francis Xavier in the 16th century.   The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by A.C. Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 (revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 Latin-edition) recorded \"Allah\" as the translation of the Dutch word \"Godt\".  Ruyl also translated Matthew in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after King James Version was published  ), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated Mark which was published in 1638.  The government of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional.  While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald.

Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia. Columbia University. p. 11. Its total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295  km (183 miles),  during which distance it descends  , draining an area of  , including the whole of central Switzerland. \"Aare River.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 9 January 2007  Course The Aar rises in the great Aar Glaciers of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass.  It runs east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Finsteraarhorn, and then northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall,  , past Guttannen. Between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aar Gorge or Aareschlucht.  A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the Lütschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun. Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake the river issues through the Nidau-Büren channel and then runs east to Büren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".From here the Aar flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn  (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau,  near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.

Burning mirrors achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light. They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of combustion could be trapped for analysis. The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved. HistoryThe technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. Vases filled with water used to start fires were known in the ancient world, and metaphorical significance was drawn (by the early Church Fathers, for instance) from the fact that the water remained cool even though the light passing through it would set materials on fire. Burning lenses were used to cauterise wounds and to light sacred fires in temples. Plutarch refers to a burning mirror made of joined triangular metal mirrors installed at the temple of the Vestal Virgins. Aristophanes mentions the burning lens in his play The Clouds (424 BC). The perpetual sacred fire in the classic temples as the Olympic torch had to be pure and to come directly from the gods. For this they used the sun\\'s rays focused with mirrors or lenses and not impure triggers.Archimedes, the renowned mathematician, was said to have used a burning glass (or more likely a large number of angled hexagonal mirrors ) as a weapon in 212 BC, when Syracuse was besieged by Marcus Claudius Marcellus. The Roman fleet was supposedly incinerated, though eventually the city was taken and Archimedes was slain. The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until the late 17th century. Successful recreations have been performed by Anthemius of Tralles (6th century AD), Proclus (6th century) (who by this means purportedly destroyed the fleet of Vitellus besieging Constantinople), Ibn Sahl in his On Burning Mirrors and Lenses (10th century), Alhazen in his Book of Optics (1021),  Roger Bacon (13th century), Giambattista della Porta and his friends (16th century), Athanasius Kircher and Gaspar Schott (17th century), the Comte du Buffon in 1740 in Paris, Ioannis Sakas in the 1970s in Greece, and others. Sakas was able to ignite a wooden boat at some distance in only seconds. Buffon, using only 48 small mirrors, was able to melt a 3 kilogram (six pound) tin bottle, and ignite wood from a distance of 46 meters (150\\xa0ft). These recreations show the plausibility of Archimedes\\' achievement.The pop science TV program MythBusters attempted to model Archimedes\\' feat by using mirrors to ignite a small wooden boat covered with tar, with only partial success—they found it too difficult to focus light from their hand-held mirrors onto a point small enough to ignite the boat. However, an episode of Richard Hammond\\'s Engineering Connections relating to the Keck Observatory (whose reflector glass is based on the Archimedes\\' Mirror) did successfully use a much smaller curved mirror to burn a wooden model, though not made of the same quality of materials as in the MythBusters effort.Recent excavations at the Viking harbor town of Fröjel, Gotland in Sweden have revealed a small number of rock crystal lenses known as the Visby lenses.  These may have been made using pole-lathes. They have an imaging quality comparable to that of 1950s aspheric lenses. The Viking lenses effectively concentrate sunlight enough to ignite fires; however it is not known whether they were used for this purpose. Similar technology may have been used in ancient Ireland (the Liath Meisicith)  and quite possibly ancient Egypt. In 1796, during the French Revolution and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, Étienne-Gaspard Robert met with the French government and proposed the use of mirrors to burn the invading ships of the British Royal Navy.  They decided not to take up his proposal. Burns, Paul.  \"The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750-1799\".  Accessed 29 July 2007. Chapter 17 of William Bates\\' 1920 book Perfect Sight Without Glasses, in which the author argues that observation of the sun is beneficial to those with poor vision, includes a figure of somebody \"Focussing the Rays of the Sun Upon the Eye of a Patient by Means of a Burning Glass.\"    Needless to say, this is highly dangerous and will damage the eye in seconds. Current useBurning glasses (often called fire lenses) are still used to light fires in outdoor and primitive settings.  Large burning lenses sometimes take the form of Fresnel lenses, similar to lighthouse lenses,     including those for use in solar furnaces.     Solar furnaces are used in industry to produce extremely high temperatures without the need for fuel or large supplies of electricity. They sometimes employ a large parabolic array of mirrors (some facilities are several storeys high) to focus light to a high intensity. The Olympic torch that is carried around the host country of the Olympic Games is lit by a burning glass, at the site of ancient Olympia in Greece.

However, the dispute over the Armenian Genocide and the recent war over Nagorno-Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO\\'s Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Trade Organization and La Francophonie. It is also an observer member of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. Eduard Nalbandyan currently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia. Armenian Genocide recognition  Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden,  Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela; additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as New South Wales in Australia and Wales in the United Kingdom. US House Resolution 106 was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill currently has 225 co-sponsors.  The bill called for former President George W. Bush to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual 24 April speech which he never used. His successor President Barack Obama has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual 24 April speech in 2009. Disputes Nagorno-Karabakh/Azerbaijan  Armenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government.The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku and Sumgait, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and forcibly occupied Baku, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to Yerevan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized Shusha and Lachin (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted four resolutions calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when Russia brokered a cease-fire.Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the OSCE. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, sniper-fire and landmine incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year. Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in Key West, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the talks on 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.The two countries are still technically at war.

Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia. Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev\\'s US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development. However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.      2006-03-21 See Armenia–San Marino relations      1993-01-14 See Armenia–Serbia relations Armenia is represented in Serbia through its embassy in Athens (Greece).

Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs about relations with Armenia       No formal diplomatic relations See Armenia–Turkey relations Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia\\'s independence in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey\\'s holding of historic Armenian lands (ceded to them in the Treaty of Kars, a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from eastern Anatolian lands of the Ottoman Empire orchestrated by the Young Turks is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide. On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to \"continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.\"  Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the Armenian SSR, it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.  Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official Yerevan is not willing to do. In the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to The Economist magazine, 70% of Armenia\\'s imports enter via Georgia. Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.       1992-12-25 See Armenia–Ukraine relations Armenian-Ukrainian relations have lasted for centuries and today are cordial.      1992-01-20 See Armenia–United Kingdom relations The United Kingdom recognised Armenia on 31 December 1991.

The two countries maintain collaborative and friendly relations, however the United Kingdom does not recognize the Armenian Genocide, as it considers that the evidence is not clear enough to respectively consider \"the terrible events that afflicted the Ottoman Armenian population at the beginning of the last century\" genocide under the 1948 UN convention. The British government states the \"massacres were an appalling tragedy\" and states that this was the view of the government during that period.  Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland consider it to be a genocide, and there is a memorial in Cardiff, Wales. British Foreign and Commonwealth Office about relations with Armenia   Asia Country Formal relations began Notes      No diplomatic relations See Armenia–Azerbaijan relations, Nagorno-Karabakh War, Khojaly Massacre, Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War) and in 1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War), in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.  The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918. The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 and in 1988–94 in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek.  During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of the Azerbaijan SSR began a movement to unify with the Armenian SSR. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The violence resulted in de facto Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France and Russia, and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.  The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.  If a person\\'s passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.  In 2008, in what became known as the 2008 Mardakert Skirmishes, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.         1992-03-18 See Armenia–Cyprus relations Cyprus was the second country to recognise the Armenian Genocide, on 24 April 1975. Armenia is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens (Greece). Cyprus is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia), and through an honorary consulate in Yerevan. There are over 3.500 people of Armenian descent living in Cyprus.  Vahan Ovanesyan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation visited Cyprus on 24 January 2001 to take part in celebrations of the 110th anniversary of the federation.  Cyprus Foreign Ministry: list of bilateral treaties with Armenia       1992-07-17 See Armenia–Georgia relations Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common. Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms \"Apostolic\" and \"Orthodox\" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term \"Catholicos\" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals). Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing Karabakh conflict, Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia\\'s reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the 2008 South Ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia\\'s imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and South Caucasus natural gas pipeline) have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On occasion, however, Georgian politicians have sympathized with the Armenian cause. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, \"We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.\"  However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.  The Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.     1992-08-31 See Armenia–India relations Since 1999, Armenia has an embassy in New Delhi and 2 honorary consulates Mumbai, and Chennai. India has an embassy in Yerevan.  Indian government is funding the renovation of schools in Lori region. Around 700 Medical students are studying in Armenian universities. Armenia recognizes Kashmir to be part of India and not of Pakistan. Armenia supports India\\'s bid for permanent seat in the UNSC.         See Armenia–Iran relations Despite religious and ideological differences, relations between Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran remain cordial and both Armenia and Iran are strategic partners in the region. Armenia and Iran enjoy cultural and historical ties that go back thousands of years. There are no border disputes between the two countries and the Christian Armenian minority in Iran enjoys official recognition. Of special importance is the cooperation in the field of energy security which lowers Armenia\\'s dependence on Russia and can in the future also supply Iranian gas to Europe through Georgia and the Black Sea.       See Armenia–Israel relations Since independence, Armenia has received support from Israel and today remains one of its major trade partners. While both countries have diplomatic relations, neither maintains an embassy in the other country. Instead, Ehude Moshe Eytam, the Israeli ambassador to Armenia is based in Tbilisi, Georgia, and visits Yerevan twice a month. Israel has recognized 10 Armenians as Righteous Among the Nations for risking their lives to save Jews during the Holocaust.     1992-09-07  See Armenia–Japan relations Armenia has an embassy in Tokyo.

Lebanon is host to the eighth largest Armenian population in the world and is the only member of the Arab League, much less of the Middle East and the Islamic World that recognizes the Armenian Genocide. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to Lebanon. According to the Armenian government, an unspecified amount of medicines, tents and fire-fighting equipment was allocated to Lebanese authorities on 27 July 2006.         See Armenia–Pakistan relations Armenia-Pakistan relations are extraordinarily poor owing to numerous disagreements. The main issue is Armenia\\'s invasion and occupation of Azerbaijan territories including Nagorno-Karabakh. Pakistan has supported territorial integrity of Azerbaijan during and after the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Pakistan also opposes Armenian irredentist claims against Turkey and Azerbaijan. Pakistan does not recognize the 1915 Genocide and maintains that during the war large number of Armenians and Muslims were killed. Armenia has friendly relations with India, and its recognition of Kashmir belonging to India has also damaged the relations with Pakistan. Pakistan is also the only country that does not recognize Armenia.   Pakistan has cultural, ethnic, historical and religious ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey. Pakistan has close military ties with Azerbaijan, trains Azerbaijani armed forces and plans to sell its JF-17 fighters to Azerbaijan.      1992-04-06 See Armenia–China relations China recognized Armenia on 21 December 1991.

For the firearm company, see Davide Pedersoli. Bud Spencer (born Carlo Pedersoli; 31 October 1929) is an  Italian actor, filmmaker and a former professional swimmer. He is known for past roles in action-comedy films together with his long-time film partner Terence Hill. Growing from a successful swimmer in his youth, he got a degree in law, and has registered several patents. Bud also became a certified commercial airline and helicopter pilot, Bud Spencer also supports and funds many children\\'s charities, including the Spencer Scholarship Fund. Bud Spencer on imdb.com  Bud Spencer and Terence Hill both appeared, produced and directed over 20 films together and thus became and still remain best friends to this present day. In a recent interview, Bud commented: \"Terence is like a brother to me, and like brothers we don\\'t always agree, and he can be a pain in the neck sometimes.\" [laughs] \"...\\xa0our relationship I suppose is reflected in our movies, but he can always count on me as I can on him. We always enjoyed working together, probably why we made so many films together.\" BiographySpencer was born in Santa Lucia, a historical rione of the city of Naples. He married Maria Amato in 1960, with whom he had three children: Giuseppe (1961), Christine (1962) and Diamante (1972). From 1947 to 1949 he worked in the Italian consulate in Recife, Brazil, where he learned fluent Portuguese. He changed his screen name in 1967 reportedly chosen to pay homage to Spencer Tracy as well as his favorite beer, Budweiser. Other sources report that he found it funny to call himself \"bud\" despite his weight and his  imposing height at almost 6\\xa0ft 4 in (193\\xa0cm).  Swimming and water polo careerA successful swimmer in his youth, Spencer was the first Italian to swim the 100 m freestyle in less than one minute.

During the 1950s and part of the 1960s, Spencer appeared in some Italian films but \"his career was strictly minor league until the late 1960s.\" Spencer met Terence Hill, with whom he made a large number of Italian Westerns and other films together, including (named using their most common US titles): Hannibal (1959), as Carlo Pedersoli together with Mario Girotti God Forgives... I Don\\'t! (1967), first time as Bud Spencer together with Terence Hill Ace High (1968) Boot Hill (1969) They Call Me Trinity (1970) Blackie the Pirate (1971) Trinity Is Still My Name (1971) All the Way, Boys (1972) Watch Out, We\\'re Mad (1974) Two Missionaries (1975) Crime Busters (1976) Odds and Evens (1978) I\\'m For the Hippopotamus (1979) Who Finds a Friend Finds a Treasure (1981) Go For It! (1983) Double Trouble (1984) Miami Supercops (1985) Troublemakers (1994) Films with Spencer in solo performance include: The Five Man Army (1969) The Fifth Day of Peace (1969) It Can Be Done Amigo (1972) Flatfoot (1973) They Call Him Bulldozer (1978) The Sheriff and the Satellite Kid (1979) Everything Happens to Me (1980) Banana Joe (1982) Bomber (1982) Superfantagenio (1986) Many of these have alternate titles, depending upon the country and distributor. Some have longer Italian versions that were edited for release abroad.  These films gathered popularity for both actors, especially in Europe.  The main dubber of Bud Spencer in Italy is Glauco Onorato who, with his characteristic voice, successfully enriched the character of Bud Spencer with many particularities. In some movies the dubber is Sergio Fiorentini (Botte di Natale, Al limite and the series of Detective Extralarge). In the movie Oggi a te domani a me the dubber is Ferruccio AmendolaSpencer also wrote the complete or partial screenplay for some of his movies. His fan base is particularly large in Europe. His feature film career slowed down after 1983, shifting more toward television. In the 1990s, he acted in the TV action-drama \"Extralarge\". Personal lifeAfter appearing in Più forte, ragazzi!, Spencer became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot.  He established Mistral Air in 1984, an air-mail company that also transports pilgrims, but later sold it to Poste Italiane to buy a textile mill that produced clothes for children. Career in politicsIn 2005, Pedersoli entered politics, unsuccessfully standing as regional counselor in Lazio for the Forza Italia party. Spencer has stated: \"In my life, I\\'ve done everything. There are only three things I haven\\'t been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I\\'ll throw myself into politics.\"  The opposition criticised him for engaging in \"politica spettacolo\" (\"showbiz politics\").  He worked for many years at the Italian Embassy in Brazil.

(founded in 1934 as National Allied Publications) is one of the largest and most successful companies operating in the market for American comic books and related media. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment,    a company of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which itself is owned by Time Warner. DC Comics produces material featuring a large number of well-known characters, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Green Arrow, Black Canary and the Martian Manhunter, along with such superhero teams as the Justice League and the Teen Titans, as well as antagonists such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Darkseid, the Riddler, Catwoman, Brainiac and the Penguin.The initials \"DC\" came from the company\\'s popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman\\'s debut and subsequently became part of the company\\'s name.     Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC has its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City.  DC Comics Inc. Hoovers. Retrieved October 18, 2008.  Random House distributes DC Comics\\' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comic Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.  DC Comics and its major, longtime competitor Marvel Comics (owned by Time Warner\\'s main rival The Walt Disney Company since 2009) together shared over 80% of the American comic-book market in 2008.  History OriginsEntrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson\\'s National Allied Publications    debuted with the tabloid-sized New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 with a cover date of February 1934. New Fun #1 (Feb. 1935) at the Grand Comics Database. The entry notes that while the logo appears to be simply Fun, the indicia reads, \"New FUN is published monthly at 49 West 45th Street, New York, N.Y., by National Allied Publications, Inc.; Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, President ... Inquiries concerning advertising should be addressed to the Advertising Manager, New FUN,....\"    The company\\'s second title, New Comics #1 (Dec. 1935), appeared in a size close to what would become comic books\\' standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, with slightly larger dimensions than today\\'s.  That title evolved into Adventure Comics, which continued through issue #503 in 1983, becoming one of the longest-running comic-book series.  In 2009 DC revived it with its original numbering.  Adventure Comics (DC, 2009 series) at the Grand Comics Database Wheeler-Nicholson\\'s third and final title, Detective Comics, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue #27 (May 1939). By then, however, Wheeler-Nicholson had gone. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld — who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News — Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics #1. Detective Comics, Inc. was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz, Donenfeld\\'s accountant, listed as owners. Major Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year, but cash-flow problems continued, and he was forced out. Shortly afterward, Detective Comics Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied, also known as Nicholson Publishing, at a bankruptcy auction. Detective Comics Inc. soon launched a fourth title, Action Comics, and the premiere of which introduced Superman (a character with which Wheeler-Nicholson had no direct involvement; editor Vin Sullivan chose to run the feature after Sheldon Mayer rescued it from the slush pile). Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the first comic book to feature the new character archetype — soon known as \"superheroes\" — proved a major sales hit. The company quickly introduced such other popular characters as the Sandman and Batman.On February 22, 2010, a copy of Action Comics #1 (June 1938) sold at auction from an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer for $1 million, besting the $317,000 record for a comic book set by a different copy, in lesser condition, the previous year.  The Golden Age National Allied Publications soon merged with Detective Comics Inc. to form National Comics, which in 1944 absorbed an affiliated concern, Max Gaines\\' and Liebowitz\\' All-American Publications. That year, Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, and kept only Picture Stories from the Bible as the foundation of his own new company, EC Comics. At that point, \"Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, [the self-distributorship] Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications\".  National Periodical Publications became publicly traded on the stock market in 1961. Despite the official names \"National Comics\" and \"National Periodical Publications\", the line used the logo \"Superman-DC\" throughout (the DC logo could be seen on their covers and ads as early as 1940), and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977. The company began to move aggressively against what it saw as copyright-violating imitations from other companies, such as Fox Comics\\' Wonder Man, which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel, at the time comics\\' top-selling character. Despite the fact that parallels between Captain Marvel and Superman seemed more tenuous (Captain Marvel\\'s powers came from magic, unlike Superman\\'s), the courts ruled that substantial and deliberate copying of copyrighted material had occurred. Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1955 and ceased comics publication. Years later, Fawcett ironically sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC — which in 1974 revived Captain Marvel in the new title Shazam! featuring artwork by his creator, C. C. Beck. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by Marvel Comics in 1967, disallowing the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning live action TV adaptation and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the DC Universe.When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as science fiction, Westerns, humor, and romance. DC also published crime and horror titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles (most notably Action Comics and Detective Comics, the medium\\'s two longest-running titles) continued publication. The Silver Age In the mid-1950s, editorial director Irwin Donenfeld and publisher Liebowitz directed editor Julius Schwartz (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a one-shot Flash story in the try-out title Showcase. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome, penciler Carmine Infantino, and inker Joe Kubert create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash\\'s civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash\\'s reimagining in Showcase #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the Green Lantern character, the introduction of the modern all-star team Justice League of America (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the Silver Age of comic books.National did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor Mort Weisinger, introduced such enduring characters as Supergirl, Bizarro, and Brainiac. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.DC\\'s introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC\\'s JLA as the specific spur,  Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)  bragged about DC\\'s success with the Justice League (which had debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to publisher Martin Goodman (whose holdings included the nascent Marvel Comics) during a game of golf.However, film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan partly debunked the story in a letter published in Alter Ego #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44: \"Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC\\'s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us ... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC owned Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News\\' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse\\'s mouth.\" Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA\\'s strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in Origins of Marvel Comics (Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books, 1974), p. 16: \"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The   Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... \\' If the Justice League is selling \\', spoke he, \\'why don\\'t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?\\'\"  Marvel Comics writer-editor Stan Lee and legendary creator Jack Kirby ushered in the sub-Silver Age \"Marvel Age\" of comics with the debut issue of The Fantastic Four. Since the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company\\'s other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC\\'s characters inhabited a shared continuity that, decades later, was dubbed the \"DC Universe\" by fans. With the story \"Flash of Two Worlds\", in Flash #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer Gardner Fox and artists Infantino and Joe Giella) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes\\' \"Earth 1\" — in the process creating the foundation for what would later be called the DC Multiverse.A 1966 Batman TV show on the ABC network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales, and a brief fad for superheroes in Saturday morning animation (Filmation created most of DC\\'s initial cartoons) and other media. DC significantly lightened the tone of many DC comics — particularly Batman and Detective Comics — to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous \"Go-Go Checks\" checkerboard cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC\\'s output \"stand out on the newsracks.\" In 1967, Batman artist Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger) rose from art director to become DC\\'s editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival Marvel Comics threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with new titles and characters, also recruiting major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko and promising newcomer Neal Adams. He also replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including Joe Kubert and Dick Giordano, to give DC\\'s output a more artistic critical eye.These new editors recruited youthful new creators, in part in an effort to capture a market which had grown from being dominated by children, to include older teens and even college students. Some new talent, such as Dennis O\\'Neil, who had worked for both Marvel and Charlton, gained critical and popular acclaim on titles including Batman and Green Lantern (his Green Lantern run with artist Neal Adams became a key title in the burgeoning 1970s Bronze Age, and the move away from the Comics Code Authority). Nevertheless, the period was plagued by short-lived series that started out strong but petered out rapidly.In 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company, which later purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and became Warner Communications.  The Fourth World In 1970, Jack Kirby moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the Silver Age of Comics, in which Kirby\\'s contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively The Fourth World. In the existing series Superman\\'s Pal Jimmy Olsen and in his own, newly launched series New Gods, Mister Miracle, and The Forever People, Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain Darkseid and the otherdimensional realm Apokolips. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management\\'s initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby\\'s conceptions would soon become integral to the broadening of the DC Universe. Kirby went on to create other \"daring and different\" series for DC, including Kamandi, about a teenaged boy in a post-apocalyptic world of anthropomorphic talking animals, when directed by the publisher to come up with something resembling Planet of the Apes. The Bronze Age Following the science-fiction innovations of the Silver Age, the comics of the 1970s and 1980s would become known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more naturalistic and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the Comics Code Authority, explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics\\' The Amazing Spider-Man in early 1971, and after the Code\\'s updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer Dennis O\\'Neil and artist Neal Adams\\' Green Lantern, beginning with the story \"Snowbirds Don\\'t Fly\" in the retitled Green Lantern / Green Arrow #85 (September 1971), which depicted Speedy, the teen sidekick of superhero archer Green Arrow, as having become a heroin addict.Jenette Kahn, a former children\\'s magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as Firestorm and Shade, the Changing Man, as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-Wertham days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the first Superman movie, Kahn expanded the line further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".  The move was not successful, however, and corporate partner Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed \"the DC Implosion.\"  In September 1978, the line was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still-increased 40 cents.  By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.Seeking new ways to boost market share, the new team of publisher Kahn, vice-president Paul Levitz, and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end — and following the example of Atlas/Seaboard Comics and such independent companies as Eclipse Comics — DC began to offer royalties in place of the industry-standard work-for-hire agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. In addition, emulating the era\\'s new television form, the miniseries while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book limited series.  This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable openended commitments.These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series The New Teen Titans, by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel\\'s ensemble series X-Men, but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales  in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and Pérez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, Tales of the New Teen Titans, to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title. Late 1980s This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans into The New Teen Titans led DC\\'s editors to seek the same for the entire line and for the wider DC Universe. The result, the Wolfman/Pérez 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the \"baggage\" of its history, address \"errors\" in the characters\\' long histories and - particularly - revise, update and streamline major characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman. A companion publication in the new prestige format, two volumes entitled The History of the DC Universe, set out briefly the revised history of the major DC characters, and set the scene for an effective reboot of all titles, while still rooted in the long tradition and history of the DC Universe. Effectively moving from the realism of the Bronze Age towards the era sometimes called the \"Dark Age,\" Crisis featured many key and resonant deaths which would shape the DC Universe for the following decades, and separate the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".Meanwhile, a parallel revolution had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since the start of 1984, British writer Alan Moore had re-energized the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing, and his acclaimed work sparked the comic-book equivalent of rock music\\'s British Invasion. Building on the dark naturalism of the Bronze Age, numerous British writers, including Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, subsequently began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror/fantasy material led not only to DC abandoning the Comics Code for particular titles scripted by those talents, but also to establishing in 1993 the Vertigo mature-readers imprint.Key titles in the subtle shift towards the Modern Age include the two DC-published limited series Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Watchmen by Moore and artist Dave Gibbons. These titles drew attention to changes at DC for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero. The new creative freedom and attendant publicity that allowed Miller to produce a dark, future Batman and Moore to create a similarly dystopian alternate history allowed DC to challenge Marvel\\'s industry lead. These titles also paved the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles as suitable reading for adults, and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these key series selling particularly well as trade paperbacks.Conversely, while the mainstream DC Universe got a shade darker, the mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC war comics, including venerable series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included Sgt. Rock, G.I. Combat, The Unknown Soldier, and Weird War Tales.In March 1989, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc., making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the first non-camp Batman movie was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of DC Archive Editions, collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with color restoration by DC\\'s long-time resident colorist, Bob LeRose. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics, when individual credits were few and far between. 1990sThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues was thought to imply that all comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC\\'s extended storylines in which Superman was killed, Batman was crippled, and superhero Green Lantern turned into the supervillain Parallax resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero\\'s replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectibles\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves. DC\\'s Piranha Press and other imprints (including the mature readers line Vertigo, and Helix, a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including trade paperback collections of individual serial comics, as well as original graphic novels. DC entered into a publishing agreement with Milestone Media that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series Static Shock. DC established Paradox Press to publish material such as the large-format Big Book of... series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel Road to Perdition. In 1998, DC purchased Wildstorm Comics, Jim Lee\\'s imprint under the Image Comics banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint - and fictional universe - with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint America\\'s Best Comics (ABC), a series of titles created by Alan Moore, including The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Tom Strong, and Promethea. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC. 2000sIn March 2003, DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series Elfquest, previously self-published by creators Wendy and Richard Pini under their WaRP Graphics publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, Tower Comics\\' series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004, DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers 2000 AD and Humanoids. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot Johnny DC, and established the CMX imprint to reprint translated manga. In 2006, CMX took over from Dark Horse Comics publication of the webcomic Megatokyo in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and acquired the rights to much of the work of Will Eisner, such as his The Spirit series and his graphic novels.In 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths, promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 Zero Hour event which similarly tried to ret-con the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded Batman Begins film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC\\'s heroes, with events climaxing in the Infinite Crisis limited series. Immediately after this event, DC\\'s ongoing series jumped forward a full year in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, 52, to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of Jerry Siegel used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership. In 2005, DC launched a new \"All-Star\" line (evoking the title of the 1940s publication), designed to feature some of the company\\'s best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe, and were produced by \"all star\" creative teams. All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder launched in July 2005, with All-Star Superman beginning in November 2005. All Star Wonder Woman and All Star Batgirl were announced in 2006, with the release of Superman Returns in movie theaters, but neither have been released or scheduled as of the end of 2009. Adam Hughes, who was initially announced as the writer/artist on All Star Wonder Woman in 2006,   explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that that project was \"in the freezer\" for the time being, due to the difficulty involved in both writing and illustrating himself.  DC EntertainmentIn September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that DC Comics would become a subsidiary of DC Entertainment, Inc., with Diane Nelson, President of Warner Premiere, becoming president of the newly formed company and DC Comics President and Publisher Paul Levitz moving to the position of Contributing Editor and Overall Consultant there. Newsarama: Warner Bros. Creates DC ENTERTAINMENT To Maximize DC Brands. Retrieved on September 9, 2009.  On February 18, 2010, DC Entertainment named Jim Lee and Dan DiDio as Co-Publishers of DC Comics, Geoff Johns as Chief Creative Officer, John Rood as EVP of Sales, Marketing and Business Development, and Patrick Caldon as EVP of Finance and Administration.  In May 2011, DC announced it would begin releasing digital versions of their comics on the same day as paper versions.  2010s: Relaunch  On June 1, 2011, DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and relaunch its comic line with 52 issue #1s, starting with Justice League on August 31, 2011 (written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee), with the rest to follow later on in September.   Logo  DC\\'s first logo appeared on the April 1940 issues of its titles. The letters \"DC\" stood for Detective Comics, the name of Batman\\'s flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication.\"The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one, and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication,\" effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC.\"In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company\\'s formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC\\'s mascot in the 1960s. In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favor of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of Action Comics, for example, read \"DC Superman.\" An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as anthologies like House of Mystery or team series such as Justice League of America, the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for \"House of Mystery.\" This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel\\'s contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.DC\\'s \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple sans-serif typeface within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square. The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.In December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that would continue in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976. When Jenette Kahn became DC\\'s publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer Milton Glaser to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and color and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the DC Archive Editions series. In July 1987, DC released variant editions of Justice League #3 and The Fury of Firestorm #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test. On May 8, 2005, a new logo was unveiled, debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy #1 and the rest of the titles the following week. In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since Batman Begins, Superman Returns, and the TV series Smallville, Justice League Unlimited and The Batman, as well as for collectibles and other merchandise. The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios  and DC executive Richard Bruning. In January 2012, a new logo was unveiled and confirmed to \"re-capture the older branding.\" The Dark Knight Rises was the first film to use the new logo. The TV series Arrow also features the new logo.

As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to ameliorate the league\\'s commercial viability and enhance its popularity, and he assisted in making the NFL the most financially sound sport\\'s enterprise, and the dominant sports attraction, in the United States (US). He was posthumously enshrined into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, and as quarterback for the Quakers, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. He was drafted into the US Army during World War I before ending his collegiate days at Penn and becoming an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, he was an assistant coach for the Temple Owls and a co-founder and co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles.With the Eagles, Bell convinced the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became the sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the Eagles and bought a stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell auspiciously argued against the league suspending operations until the war\\'s conclusion.After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling agenda, negotiated a merger with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on augmenting the dramatic effect of late season matches. During the Golden Age of Television, he tailored the game\\'s rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media, and enforced a blackout policy of locally televised home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amidst criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from Congress, he unilaterally recognized the NFLPA and facilitated in the composing of the first pension plan for the players. His life would abide to oversee the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\" and to envision what the league would become in the future. Early life (1895–1932)Bell was born de Benneville Bell,  on February 25, 1895,  in Philadelphia to John C. Bell and Fleurette de Benneville Myers.  His father was an attorney who was elected the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Lyons: 3  His older brother, John C. Jr., was born in 1892.  Bert\\'s parents were very wealthy,  and his mother\\'s lineage predated the American Revolutionary War.  His father, a Quaker of the University of Pennsylvania (class of 1884) during the early days of American football,  accompanied him to his first football game when Bell was six years old. Sullivan: 23–24  Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends. Lyons: 3–4. In 1904, Bell matriculated at the Episcopal Academy, the Delancey School from 1909 to 1911 and then the Haverford School until 1914.  About this time, his father was installed as athletics director at Penn  and helped form the NCAA. Lyons: 2–3, 5.  At Haverford, Bell captained the school\\'s football, basketball, and baseball teams,  and \"was awarded The Yale Cup  [for being]  \\'The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school.\\'\"    Although he excelled at baseball, his devotion was to football.  His father, who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911,  said of Bell\\'s plans for college, \"Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell.\"  University of Pennsylvania (1914–1919) Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined Phi Kappa Sigma. Lyons: 5–7   In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn\\'s coach George H. Brooke.  On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner.    After the team\\'s 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season,  as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2. MacCambridge 2009: 1080 Prior to Penn\\'s 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside. Lyons:7-8  Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach Bob Folwell, but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season.  Penn finished with a record of 7–2–1.  However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the 1917 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks.  Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20-14 loss to Oregon was a 20 yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception. In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2–0 finish,  and afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for World War I and was deployed to France in May 1918. Lyons: 11–15  As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from General John J. Pershing,  and Bell was promoted to top sergeant. Lyons: 16–20.  After the war ended, Bell arrived back in the United States in March 1919.  He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically.  The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record.  Academically, his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920.  His collegiate days ended with him having been a borderline All-American,  but this period of his life had proven that he \"possessed the qualities of a leader.\"  Early career (1920–1932)Bell assembled the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal.  He joined John Heisman\\'s staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920, and Bell would remain thereat for several years. Lyons: 22–23.  At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities.  At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing  and frequenting Saratoga Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George Preston Marshall.  In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray, a fellow assistant coach. Lyons: 25–27  Bell\\'s resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season. Bell was then an employee of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one ponit, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $ ) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lyons: 30-32  His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz.  From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team.  In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea.  When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.  NFL career Philadelphia Eagles (1933–1940)By early 1933, Bell\\'s opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 56, 95.  However, college football games were provisioned for Saturdays, attracted a far greater attendance than NFL games,  and the Pennsylvania Blue Laws prohibited the patronizing of professional football on Sundays. Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95   After being advised a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the blue laws would have to be mollified, Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95  he was the force majeure to getting the laws deprecated.  He was then informed that any new franchise in Philadelphia would have to reimburse the arrears owed by the Frankford Yellow Jackets.  Bell, thereabouts, partnered with Wray, Lyons: 46–47; cf. Claassen: 336, MacCambridge 2005: 42, Peterson: 112, Westcott: 101  and they conceded to guarantee Frankford\\'s debt. Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 28  However, they needed more capital to pay the  league entrance fee, pay off the debt of the Yellow Jackets, and assemble a team.  Bell attempted to persuade his father to lend him money, but his father deplored football as a livelihood and would not abet him.  Consequently, Bell borrowed funds from Frances Upton, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia,  became its president,  and christened the team the Philadelphia Eagles  After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season,  Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia.  Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed.  In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record,  The Eagles\\' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets,  and his failure to sign a talented college prospect  led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players.  In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted,  and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born. In the Eagles\\' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, $ ),  and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, $ ).  Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles,  wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1–11 finish, their worst record ever (as of the   season).  In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles\\' 2-8-1 1937 season,  his second child, John \"Upton\", was born.  In the Eagles\\' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5–6 record.  The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in 1939 and 1–10 in 1940.  Pittsburgh Steelers (1940–1945)In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooney\\'s Steelers to Alexis Thompson, Algeo: 16  and then Rooney acquired half of Bell\\'s interest in the Eagles.  In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka,  Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.  Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.  Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager. During the training camp of the Pittsburgh\\'s inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team\\'s prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the \"[s]ame old Steelers\" (SOS).  After losing the first two games of the 1941 season, Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach.  Bell\\'s coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, and for coaches with at least five years in the NFL, it is the worst record ever (as of the 2012 season).  His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the season\\'s conclusion. By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the United States Armed Forces for World War II.  The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also. Throughout Bell\\'s affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him.  Compounding Bell\\'s problems, Arch Ward organized the All-American Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL\\'s sovereignty in professional football.  Ward\\'s AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league,  which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically.  In Bill Dudley\\'s contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell\\'s anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC.  Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.  NFL commissioner (1946–1959) Election, Hapes-Filchock, and the NFL schedule (1946–1948)Elmer Layden was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring.  Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946.  Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh,  was elected to replace him.  He received a three-year contract at $20,000 ($ ) per year,  and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney,  albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value. Lyons: 166–167  He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied Dan Reeves permission to relocate the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles. MacCambridge 2005: 15–16; cf. Davis 2005: 201–202, Yost: 57–58: Lyons: 117–118  Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the Los Angeles Rams were formed.  As a precondition to the Rams leasing the Los Angeles Coliseum, they signed Kenny Washington, which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused \"\\'all hell to break loose\\'\" amidst the owners.  The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league\\'s inception.  The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team\\'s win-loss record.  The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league\\'s schedule.  He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. Sullivan: 26; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248  His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible. On the eve of the 1946 championship game, Bell was notified that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal.  Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended.  At the next NFL owners\\' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing.    However he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Lyons: 129  Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs. Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution,  which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed.  Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games,  and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game.  Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events Lyons: 142  and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.  AAFC-NFL merger (1948–1950)The NFL\\'s struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages,  attendance,  marketing,  and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years.  Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless.  In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.  Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL\\'s first television contract —the 1949 championship game.  Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC.  Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell. One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of \"territorial rights\" claimed by Marshall.   Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC.  In late 1949, the leagues merged, Lyons: 150, 163; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 52  and Bell would stay on as commissioner  with his contract extended from five to ten years  as three AAFC teams (the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts) were subsumed.  Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized \"exquisite dramatic\" and business sense and allocated the 1950 opening game to a contest between the 1949 champion Eagles versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns.  Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home for himself and his family in Narberth, Pennsylvania.  Marketing of the NFL (1950–1956)In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75 mile radius of their stadium - except for the Rams.   Consequently, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%,  and this signaled a potential financial disaster.  In 1951, he licensed the DuMont Television Network to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently. However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league.  The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, \"You can\\'t give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark\"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952.  After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL.  He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week,   and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams.  In the DOJ\\'s case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract;  Bell was ecstatic.  Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns\\' football games.  Although he hated to fly,  at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league. Bell authorized a Pro Bowl to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players.  But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline assault and battery  with teams\\' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players.  He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, \"\\'I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don\\'t believe there are any.\\'\"  Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were \"\\'salesman for professional football  [and]  we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.\\'\" Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product.  After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956,  he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give \"\\'us our greatest opportunity to sell the  NFL  and everyone must present to the public the greatest games\\xa0... combined with the finest sportsmanship.\\'\"  This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL\\'s rise to becoming America\\'s most popular sport.  Compromise with the NFLPA (1956–1957)In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court ruled in Radovich\\'s favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws,  and the implication was that the legality of the draft and reserve clause were dubious.  Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.  He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court\\'s ruling.  The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision.  Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee\\'s solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport\\'s success.  Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position.    Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives. However, Bell was speaking only for himself and without the auspices of the owners. Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 78  At the next owners\\' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. Rooney; Halaas and Masich, 2007, p. 78.  In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority.  Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. Staudohar, 1986, 63; cf. Oriard: 57  However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA\\'s requests for salary standards and health benefits.  Final days (1958–1959)For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds  and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters.  The 1958 championship game became the first NFL championship game decided in overtime  and it was considered to be the greatest football game ever played.  The game further increased football\\'s marketability to television advertising,  and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst.  Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell\\'s realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport. The death of Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a heart attack later that month. Lyons: 308  He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife,  Mara\\'s death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney,  a practicing Catholic.  Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, \"I\\'d rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off.\"  Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field in October 1959. Lyons: 275  The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans.  Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and passed away later that day.  His funeral was held at Narberth\\'s St. Margaret Roman Catholic Church and Monsignor Cornelius P. Brennan delivered the eulogy, as close friends and admirers attended the mass. Lyons: 312  Dominic Olejniczak and all the extant owners of the NFL franchises were pallbearers.  Bell was interred at Cavalry Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.  Legacy and honors Bell was inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame,  Lyons: 315  the Penn Athletics Hall of Fame,  the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame,  and Haverford\\'s Athletic Hall of Fame.  The Maxwell Football Club, which he founded in 1937,  has presented the best NFL player of the year with the Bert Bell Award since 1959.  The Bert Bell Benefit Bowl was exhibited in his honor from 1960 through 1969. Bell was \"a man of buoyant joviality,   with a rough and ready wit,  laughter and genuine humility and honesty, clearly innocent of pretense and  [pretension] .\"  Though his career spanned the desegregation and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, he never had an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd.  Bell\\'s handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.  Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games,  he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers,  and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.  Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally.  Nevertheless, his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the \"healthiest professional sport in America\",  and he was the \"leading protagonist in pro football\\'s evolution into America\\'s major sport.\"  He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it.  He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly,  and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a \"master stroke\" in thwarting Congressional intervention.  After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with the NFLPA,   however, the first players\\' pension plan-the Bert Bell National Football League Retirement Plan, was approved in 1962.  Bell\\'s implementation of the draft did not show immediate results,  but it was \"the single greatest contributor to the  [league]\\'s  prosperity\" in its first eighty-four years.  His original version of the draft was later ruled unconstitutional,  but his anchoring of the success of the league to competitive balance has been \"hailed by contemporaries and sports historians\".

It is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors. It was presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.The speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of 1 hour cannot be parallelized, while the remaining promising portion of 19 hours (95%) can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors we devote to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical 1 hour. Hence the speedup is limited up to 20×, as the diagram illustrates. DescriptionAmdahl\\'s law is a model for the relationship between the expected speedup of parallelized implementations of an algorithm relative to the serial algorithm, under the assumption that the problem size remains the same when parallelized. For example, if for a given problem size a parallelized implementation of an algorithm can run 12% of the algorithm\\'s operations arbitrarily quickly (while the remaining 88% of the operations are not parallelizable), Amdahl\\'s law states that the maximum speedup of the parallelized version is   times as fast as the non-parallelized implementation.More technically, the law is concerned with the speedup achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion P of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of S. (For example, if 30% of the computation may be the subject of a speed up, P will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, S will be 2.) Amdahl\\'s law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be:  \\\\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\\\frac{P}{S}} = \\\\frac{1}{(1 - 0.3) + \\\\frac{0.3}{2}} = 1.1765  To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 − P), plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part\\'s former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part P/S. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.Here\\'s another example. We are given a sequential task which is split into four consecutive parts: P1, P2, P3 and P4 with the percentages of runtime being 11%, 18%, 23% and 48% respectively.  Then we are told that P1 is not speed up, so S1 = 1, while P2 is speed up 5×, P3 is speed up 20×, and P4 is speed up 1.6×. By using the formula P1/S1 + P2/S2 + P3/S3 + P4/S4, we find the new sequential running time is:  \\\\frac{0.11}{1} + \\\\frac{0.18}{5} + \\\\frac{0.23}{20} + \\\\frac{0.48}{1.6} = 0.4575.  or a little less than   the original running time. Using the formula  , the overall speed boost is 1 / 0.4575 = 2.186, or a little more than double the original speed.  Notice how the 20× and 5× speedup don\\'t have much effect on the overall speed when P1 (11%) is not sped up, and P4 (48%) is sped up only 1.6 times. ParallelizationIn the case of parallelization, Amdahl\\'s law states that if P is the proportion of a program that can be made parallel (i.e., benefit from parallelization), and (1 − P) is the proportion that cannot be parallelized (remains serial), then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using N processors is  S(N) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-P) + \\\\frac{P}{N}} . In the limit, as N tends to infinity, the maximum speedup tends to 1 / (1 − P). In practice, performance to price ratio falls rapidly as N is increased once there is even a small component of (1 − P).As an example, if P is 90%, then (1 − P) is 10%, and the problem can be sped up by a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of N used. For this reason, parallel computing is only useful for either small numbers of processors, or problems with very high values of P: so-called embarrassingly parallel problems. A great part of the craft of parallel programming consists of attempting to reduce the component (1 – P) to the smallest possible value.P can be estimated by using the measured speedup (SU) on a specific number of processors (NP) using  P_\\\\text{estimated} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{SU} - 1}{\\\\frac{1}{NP} - 1} . P estimated in this way can then be used in Amdahl\\'s law to predict speedup for a different number of processors. Relation to law of diminishing returnsAmdahl\\'s law is often conflated with the law of diminishing returns, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl\\'s law demonstrates \\'law of diminishing returns\\'. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speed-up) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is \"non-optimal\" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or consuming of development time than others.Amdahl\\'s law does represent the law of diminishing returns if you are considering what sort of return you get by adding more processors to a machine, if you are running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor you add to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time you double the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of  \\\\scriptstyle 1 / (1 \\\\,-\\\\, P) .This analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth, if they do not scale with the number of processors; however, taking into account such bottlenecks would tend to further demonstrate the diminishing returns of only adding processors. Speedup in a sequential program The maximum speedup in an improved sequential program, where some part was sped up  p  times is limited by inequality  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{p}{1 + f \\\\cdot (p - 1)}  where  \\\\scriptstyle f  ( \\\\scriptstyle 0 \\\\; ) is the fraction of time (before the improvement) spent in the part that was not improved. For example (see picture on right): If part B is made five times faster ( \\\\scriptstyle p \\\\;=\\\\; 5 ),  \\\\scriptstyle t_A \\\\;=\\\\; 3 ,  \\\\scriptstyle t_B \\\\;=\\\\; 1 , and  \\\\scriptstyle f \\\\;=\\\\; t_A / (t_A \\\\,+\\\\, t_B) \\\\;=\\\\; 0.75 , then  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{5}{1 + 0.75 \\\\cdot (5 - 1)} = 1.25  If part A is made to run twice as fast ( \\\\scriptstyle p \\\\;=\\\\; 2 ),  \\\\scriptstyle t_B \\\\;=\\\\; 1 ,  \\\\scriptstyle t_A \\\\;=\\\\; 3 , and  \\\\scriptstyle f \\\\;=\\\\; t_B / (t_A \\\\,+\\\\, t_B) \\\\;=\\\\; 0.25 , then  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{2}{1 + 0.25 \\\\cdot (2 - 1)} = 1.60  Therefore, making A twice as fast is better than making B five times faster. The percentage improvement in speed can be calculated as  \\\\text{percentage improvement} = \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{speedup factor}}\\\\right) \\\\cdot 100  Improving part A by a factor of two will increase overall program speed by a factor of 1.6, which makes it 37.5% faster than the original computation. However, improving part B by a factor of five, which presumably requires more effort, will only achieve an overall speedup factor of 1.25, which makes it 20% faster. Relation to Gustafson\\'s Law John L. Gustafson pointed out in 1988 what is now known as Gustafson\\'s Law: people typically are not interested in solving a fixed problem in the shortest possible period of time, as Amdahl\\'s Law describes, but rather in solving the largest possible problem (e.g., the most accurate possible approximation) in a fixed \"reasonable\" amount of time.  If the non-parallelizable portion of the problem is fixed, or grows very slowly with problem size (e.g., O(log n)), then additional processors can increase the possible problem size without limit.

They are named after the Biblical character Cush, who was traditionally identified as an ancestor of the speakers of these specific languages as early as AD 947 (in Masudi\\'s Arabic history Meadows of Gold).  The most populous Cushitic language is Oromo with about 35 million speakers, followed by Somali with about 18 million speakers, and Sidamo in Ethiopia with about 2 million speakers. Other languages with more than one million speakers are Hadia (1.6 million), Kambata (1.4 million), and Afar (1.5 million). CompositionThere are six clearly valid groups of languages which are usually included in the Cushitic family (Beja, Agaw, Sidamic, Lowland East Cushitic, Dullay, and South Cushitic), as well as a few poorly classified languages (Yaaku, Dahalo, Aasax and Kw\\'adza, Boon, and the Cushitic element of Mbugu). However, there is a wide range of opinions as to how they are interrelated. Richard Hayward, \"Afroasiatic\", in Heine & Nurse, 2000, African Languages The Beja language, or North Cushitic, is sometimes placed outside Cushitic proper. The positions of the Dullay languages and Yaaku are uncertain. These have traditionally been assigned to an East Cushitic branch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward believes East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic. Hetzron (1980:70ff)  and Ehret (1995) have suggested that the Rift languages (South Cushitic) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic, the only one of the six groups with much internal diversity.Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the Omotic languages, then called West Cushitic. However, this view has largely been abandoned, with Omotic generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of Harold C. Fleming (1974) and M. Lionel Bender (1975). References  Ethnologue entry for Cushitic languages Bender, Marvin Lionel. 1975. Omotic: a new Afroasiatic language family. Southern Illinois University Museum series, number 3.

    "document_4 = '8485\\tDiego Maradona\\tDiego Armando Maradona ( , born 30 October 1960) is an Argentine football coach as well as a manager and former player. Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans in general consider Maradona to be the greatest football player of all time.     He was joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pelé.  \"Maradona or Pele?\". CNN Sports Illustrated. Retrieved 13 March 2013 He is the only footballer to set world-record contract fees twice, firstly when transferring to Barcelona for a then world record £5m, and secondly, when transferred to Napoli for another record fee £6.9m. During his professional club career Maradona played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell\\'s Old Boys. At club level, he is most famous for his career in Napoli where he won numerous accolades. In his international career, playing for Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals.He played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments, including the 1986 tournament, where he captained Argentina and led them to their victory over West Germany in the final, winning the Golden Ball award as the tournament\\'s best player. In that same tournament\\'s quarterfinal round, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history, though for two different reasons. The first goal was via an unpenalized handball known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a   dribble past five England players, voted  \"The Goal of the Century\" by FIFA.com voters in 2002. Maradona is considered one of the sport\\'s most controversial and newsworthy figures. He was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after failing a drug test, for cocaine, in Italy, and he was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the USA after testing positive for ephedrine. In 2005, he lost the weight and he overcame his cocaine addiction. His outspoken manners have sometimes put him at odds with journalists and sport executives. Although he had little managerial experience, he became head coach of the Argentina national team in November 2008, and held the job for eighteen months, until his contract expired after the 2010 World Cup. Early yearsMaradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policlínico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province, but raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires,  to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province. He was the first son after three daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players. Maradona has Spanish, and indigenous ancestry. He was the fifth child and first son of ‘Chitoro’ Diego Maradona and ‘Doña Tota’ Dalma Salvadora Franco (1930–2011). Both his parents were illegitimate children; his father took the family name of his mother because his father did not recognise him as his own while his mother was only recognised by her father, Maradona’s grandfather Atanancio Ramón Edisto Franco when she was eighteen years old. They were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes Province, living only two hundred yards from each other on the banks of the Corriente River. In 1950, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. Maradona is a mestizo, a term traditionally used in Spain and Latin America for people of mixed Native American and European descent. There is a dispute as to the source of the name Maradona. It had long been believed that it was of Italian origin, however Spanish researchers assert that the name originated from the region of Galicia. At age 10, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighborhood club Estrella Roja. He became a staple of Los Cebollitas (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires\\'s Argentinos Juniors. As a 12-year-old ball boy, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games.  Club career Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors On 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut with Argentinos Juniors, ten days before his sixteenth birthday. A SUMMARY OF MARADONA\\'s LIFE www.vivadiego.com. Retrieved 18 August 2006.  He played there between 1976 and 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his £1m transfer to Boca Juniors. Having joined the Boca squad midway through the 1981 season, Maradona played through 1982 earning his first league championship medal. Whilst playing for Argentinos Juniors, English club Sheffield United negotiated a fee of £600,000 for the 17 year old but then realised they couldn\\'t afford it.  BarcelonaAfter the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to FC Barcelona in Spain for a then world record £5m ($7.6m).  In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain\\'s annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. However, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona. That\\'s one hell of a diet, Diego 8 January 2006. Guardian Newspapers Limited. Retrieved 13 August 2006.  First a bout with hepatitis, then a broken ankle caused by an ill-timed tackle by Athletic\\'s Andoni Goikoetxea threatened with jeopardizing Maradona\\'s career,  but after treatment and therapy it was possible for him to soon be back on the pitch.  During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games.  At Barcelona, Maradona got into frequent disputes with the team\\'s directors, especially club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. He was transferred to Napoli in Italy\\'s Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9m ($10.48m).  Napoli At Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional career. He quickly became an adored star among the club\\'s fans, and in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history. Led by Maradona, Napoli won their only Serie A Italian Championships in 1986/87 and 1989/1990, placing second in the league twice, in 1987/88 and 1988/89. Other honors during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987, (second place in the Coppa Italia in 1989), the UEFA Cup in 1989 and the Italian Supercup in 1990. Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987/88.During his time in Italy, Maradona\\'s personal problems increased. His cocaine use continued, and he received US $70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices, ostensibly because of \\'stress\\'.  He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son; and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra.     Later on, in honor of Maradona and his achievements during his career at Napoli, the #10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired.  Sevilla, Newell\\'s Old Boys and Boca JuniorsAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992. Despite interest from Real Madrid of Spain and Olympique Marseille of France, he signed for Sevilla of Spain, where he stayed for one year.  In 1993 he played for Newell\\'s Old Boys and in 1995 he returned to Boca Juniors for two years.  Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a friendly match against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup. The match was Osvaldo Ardiles\\' testimonial, who insisted his friend Maradona played, which Tottenham won 2–1. He played alongside Glenn Hoddle, who gave up his number ten shirt for the Argentine.    International career Along with his time at Napoli, international football is where Maradona found his fame. Playing for the Albicelestes of the Argentina national football team, he participated in four consecutive FIFA World Cup tournaments, leading Argentina to victory in 1986 and to second place in 1990.He made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary on 27 February 1977. At age 18, he played the World Youth Championship for Argentina, and was the star of the tournament, shining in their 3–1 final win over the Soviet Union. On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3–1 win against Scotland at Hampden Park.  He is the only player to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup, in 1979 and 1986. 1982 World Cup Maradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Diego Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations.  Argentina, the defending champions, lost to Belgium 1–0. Although the team convincingly beat Hungary and El Salvador to progress to the second round, they were defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina in Maradona\\'s new home city of Barcelona.  Maradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary, but was sent off with 5 minutes remaining in the game against Brazil for serious foul play.  1986 World Cup Maradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, winning the final in Mexico against West Germany. Throughout the 1986 World Cup Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the tournament. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scored 5 goals and made 5 assists, three of those in the opening match against South Korea. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game.  After scoring two goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win against England his legend was cemented.This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom and emotions were still lingering in the air throughout the entire match. Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God.\" It became known as the \"Hand of God\". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005 Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.    Maradona\\'s second goal, just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal, was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. He received the ball in his own half, swivelled around, and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English outfield players (Peter Beardsley, Steve Hodge, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, and Terry Fenwick) and goalkeeper Peter Shilton. This goal was voted \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA.   Maradona followed this with two more goals in the semi-final against Belgium, including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal. In the final, the opposing West German side attempted to contain him by double-marking, but he nevertheless found the space to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3–2 in front of 115,000 spectators at the Azteca Stadium.During the course of the tournament, Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina\\'s shots, embarked on 90 dribbles some three times more than any other player and was fouled 53 times winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player.  Darby, James. (10 June 2010) WorldCup Legends: Maradona. Goal.com. Retrieved on 31 March 2013.  Maradona scored or assisted 10 of Argentina\\'s 14 goals including the assist for the winning goal in the final, ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history. By the end of the tournament, Maradona went on to winning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly.     In a tribute to him, the Azteca Stadium authorities also built a statue of him scoring the \"goal of the century\" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium.  1990 World Cup Maradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 FIFA World Cup to yet another World Cup Final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier. Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.In the quarter final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia, the match ending 0–0 after 120 minutes, and Argentina advancing on penalty kicks, despite Maradona missing one of the penalties in the shootout with a weak shot to the goalkeeper\\'s right. The semifinal against the host nation Italy was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw; this time, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his missed shot in the previous round. In the final, Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany, the only goal being a penalty by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute after a controversial foul on Rudi Völler. 1994 World CupAt the 1994 FIFA World Cup Maradona played in only two games, scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping. In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA \\'94 and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the second round. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.  His failed drugs test at the 1994 World Cup signaled the end of his international career, which had lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games. Playing style  Maradona had a compact physique and could withstand physical pressure well. His strong legs and low center of gravity gave him an advantage in short sprints. His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. Maradona was a strategist and a team player, as well as highly technical with the ball. He could manage himself effectively in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second 1986 goal against England),  or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot.One of Maradona\\'s trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent\\'s goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the Rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight. This maneuver led to several assists, such as the powerful cross for Ramón Díaz\\'s header in the 1980 friendly against Switzerland. He was also a dangerous free kick taker.Maradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection. His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \"Goal of the Century\", he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the 1990 World Cup second round tie against Brazil, he did use his right foot to set up the winning goal for Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical. Retirement and honours Hounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters who he claimed were invading his privacy. This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarizes the feelings of many:  In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography Yo Soy El Diego (\"I am The Diego\"), which became an instant bestseller  in his home country. Two years later, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \"the Cuban people and Fidel.\" In 1999, he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet based poll by wide margins, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé. In spite of this, and shortly before the ceremony, FIFA unexpectedly decided to add a second award and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pelé the title of best player of the century to make it a draw.  Maradona also came fifth in the vote of IFFHS(International Federation of Football History and Statistics).  In 1999 Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in Sports in the last decade in his country.In 2001, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would.  Maradona has topped a number of fan polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team. On 22 March 2010, Maradona was chosen number 1 in The Greatest 10 World Cup players of all time by the London based newspaper The Times.  Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003.In 2003, Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, as a \"technical consultant\", while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club, Perugia Calcio, which was in Serie A at the time. On 22 June 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to Boca Juniors as a sports vice president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing 2004–05 season, which coincided with Boca\\'s centenary).  His contract began 1 August 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: he was the one who decided to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach. With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players, Boca went on to win the 2005 Apertura title, the 2006 Clausura title, the 2005 Copa Sudamericana and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana. On 15 August 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, La Noche del 10 (\"The Night of the no. 10\"). His main guest on opening night was Pelé; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences. However, the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pelé. In subsequent evenings, he led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including Zidane, Ronaldo and Hernán Crespo, but also included interviews with other notable personalities such as Fidel Castro and Mike Tyson.On 26 August 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national football team. The award-winning Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made a documentary about Maradona\\'s life, entitled Maradona.In May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK\\'s Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for Unicef).  In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. Also in 2006, it was claimed by IIMSAM that Diego Maradona was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador of IIMSAM the Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Micro-algae Spirulina Against Malnutrition.  Managerial career Club managementHe attempted to work as a coach alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield team mate Carlos Fren. The pair led Mandiyú of Corrientes (1994) and Racing Club (1995), but with little success.  In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates. Maradona was sacked in 10 July 2012.    International managementAfter the resignation of Argentina national football team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Diego Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role. According to several press sources, his major challengers included Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel Ángel Russo and Sergio Batista.On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national side from December 2008. On 19 November 2008, Diego Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when Argentina played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow which Argentina won 1–0. After winning his first three matches in charge of the national team, he oversaw a 6–1 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team\\'s worst ever margin of defeat. With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals.  After Argentina\\'s qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\".  FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct.   The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the   on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona\\'s ban was a friendly away to  , which Argentina lost 4–2.At the World Cup finals in June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, and then defeated South Korea by 4–1, with a hat-trick from Gonzalo Higuain.   In the final match of the group stage Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win their the group and advance to a second round meeting with Mexico.  After defeating Mexico 3–1, Argentina was in turn routed by Germany, 4–0 in the quarter finals to go out of the competition.  Argentina was ranked 5th in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, \"I may leave tomorrow,\" he said.  On 15 July 2010, the Argentine Football Association said that he would be offered a new 4 year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup,  however on 27 July the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.  Afterwards on 29 July 2010, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\" and \"betrayed\" and effectively sacked him from the role. Saying \"they wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working\".  Personal life FamilyHis parents are Diego Maradona Snr and Dalma Salvadore Franco. His father is of Native American origin.   Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1984 in Buenos Aires, and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born on 2 April 1987) and Giannina Dinorah (born on 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009.  In his autobiography, Maradona admits he was not always faithful to Claudia, even though he refers to her as the love of his life.Maradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Napoli for a series of homages in June 2005  and were seen together on many other occasions, including the Argentina matches during 2006 FIFA World Cup.During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted he was the father of Diego Sinagra (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already so ruled in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests for proving or disproving his paternity. Diego Jr. met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing.   Diego Sinagra is now a footballer playing in Italy.   After the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma was seeking an acting career; she had expressed her desire to attend the Actor\\'s Studio in Los Angeles.  His younger daughter, Giannina, is currently married to Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero, with whom she has a son, Benjamin, born in Madrid on 19 February 2009.His Mother, Dalma, died on 19 November 2011. Diego was in Dubai at the time, and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her, but was too late. She was 81 years old.His son Diego Fernando whom he had with his ex long term partner Veronica Ojeda was born 13 February of 2013. Drug abuse and health issues From the mid-1980s until 2004 Diego Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.   By the time he was playing for Napoli he had a regular addiction, which began to interfere with his ability to play football. Over the years following his retirement his health seriously deteriorated. On 4 January 2000, while vacationing in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Maradona had to be rushed to the emergency room of a local clinic. In a press conference, doctors stated that it was detected heart muscle damage due to \"an underlying health issue\". It was later known that traces of cocaine were found in his blood and Maradona had to explain the circumstances to the police. After this he left Argentina and went to Cuba in order to follow a drug rehab plan.On 18 April 2004, doctors reported that Maradona had suffered a major myocardial infarction following a cocaine overdose; he was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital. Scores of fans gathered around the clinic. He was taken off the respirator on 23 April and remained in intensive care for several days before being discharged on 29 April. He tried to return to Cuba, where he had spent most of his time in the years leading up to the heart attack, but his family opposed, having filed a judicial petition to exercise his legal guardianship.Maradona had a tendency to put on weight, and suffered increasingly from obesity from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 6 March 2005.    His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return back his normal weight.  When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.   On 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse, and was released on 11 April, but re-admitted two days later.  In the following days there were constant rumors about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month.  After transfer to a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems, he was discharged on 7 May. On 8 May 2007, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years.  Political views Only in recent years, Maradona has shown sympathy to left-wing ideologies. Before that he had been vocal in his support of neoliberal Argentina President Carlos Menem, and especially of his Harvard University-educated economist Domingo Cavallo. He became friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island. He also has a portrait of Fidel Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel\\'s second in command, fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm.  In his autobiography, El Diego, he dedicated the book to several people and groups of people including Fidel Castro, he wrote \"To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the Cuban people\". Maradona was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In 2005 he visited Venezuela with the specific aim of meeting Chávez, who received him in Miraflores. After this meeting Maradona claimed that he had come with the aim of meeting a \"great man\" (\"un grande\" in Spanish) but he had met instead a gigantic man (\"un gigante\" in Spanish, meaning he was more than great).\"I believe in Chávez, I am Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Chávez does, for me is the best.\" He has declared his opposition to what he identifies as imperialism, notably during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush\\'s presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labeled \" STOP BUSH \" (with the \"s\" in \"Bush\" being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as \"human garbage\".  In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Chávez\\'s weekly television show and saying: \"I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength.\"  In December 2007, Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran: it is to be displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\' museum.    Financial problemsIn March 2009 Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government €37\\xa0million in taxes; €23.5\\xa0million of which was accrued interest on his original debt. They reported that thus far, Maradona has paid only €42,000, two luxury watches and a set of earrings.   In popular cultureThe American newspaper The Houston Chronicle wrote about Maradona:  In Argentina, Maradona is considered a sports hero to many. He is idolized, receiving the name of “God”. About this idolatry that exists in Argentina over Maradona, his former teammate Jorge Valdano said: \"At the time that Maradona retired from active football, left traumatized Argentina. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. It was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds\". Valdano added that \"Maradona offered to the Argentines way out of their collective frustration, and that\\'s why people love him. There is a divine figure.\"Ever since 1986, it is common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona\\'s name as a token of recognition, even in remote places.  The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England.  In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film El Hijo de la Novia (\"Son of the Bride\"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron: \"they idolized him and then crucified him\". When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts: \"But I was talking about Maradona\". He\\'s the subject of the film El Camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.Maradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book El Cazador de Aventuras. After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled \"El Die\",  using Maradona as the main character.In Rosario, Argentina, locals organized the parody religion of the \"Church of Maradona\".

Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having drunk too much of the Brazilian soft drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it via internet). Maradona replied that he has no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors\\' traditional rival.

Diab is the best-selling Arab recording artist of all time, according to Amr Diab Official website. He was awarded the World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist three times: 1998 for album \"Nour El Ain\", 2002 for album \"Aktrr Wahed Byhbak 2001\" and 2007 for album \"El Lillady\". Amr Diab also won The African Music Awards 2009, Big Apple Music Awards; Life Achievements Awards: Best Singer of The Year in 2009, and Best Male Act in African Music Awards 2010. Amr Diab is one of the top singers in the Arab world and considered a living legend by many of his fans in the Arab world. He is known as the Father of Mediterranean Music.    He has created his own style which is often termed \"Mediterranean Music\" or \"Mediterranean Sound\", a blend of Western and Egyptian rhythms.   In The Mediterranean in Music, David Cooper and Kevin Dawe referred to his music as \"the new breed of Mediterranean music\".  According to author Michael Frishkopf, Amr Diab has produced a new concept of Mediterranean music, especially in his international hit, \"Nour El Ain\". In his analysis of The Very Best of Amr Diab album, Victor W. Valdivia of Allmusic said: \"His music melded traditional Arabic sounds and textures with Western rhythms and instruments. The mesh was dubbed Mediterranean music, and The Very Best of Amr Diab displays Diab\\'s superb skill in creating it.\" Amr Diab is considered the biggest Egyptian pop star ever and according to the BBC, Diab \"has ruled the Arab music world, especially Egypt and the Middle East, since the mid \\'80s, continually breaking sales records\".  Musical career In 1983, Diab released his first studio album, Ya Tareeq. Diab released three more albums between 1984 and 1987. 1988\\'s \"Mayaal\" garnered huge success all around the Middle East. It was produced, arranged and remixed by German musicians, Frank Von Dem Bottlenberg, Ziyad Abou Chair and Jörg Evers, with several releases. More success followed in the following years including the albums Shawakkna, Matkhafesh, and We Yloumouni.Amr Diab quickly developed fame for his new style of \"Pan-Mediterranean\" Arabic music, fusing touches of flamenco and raï with western pop with traditional Arabic rhythms. B1992, he became the first Arabic artist to start making high-tech music videos. \"Habibi\" from Diab\\'s 1996 album Nour El Ain became a hit worldwide and was remixed by many of the world\\'s top DJs at the time.  A special CD named Habibi: The Remix Album was released later with all of these remixes. Since then, Diab has remained at the top of the Arabic music scene, expanding reach to all parts of the Mediterranean with his 1999 release, Amarain, that featured duets with Algeria\\'s king of rai Khaled in a song called \"Qalbi\" and Greece\\'s Angela Dimitriou in \"Ana Bahibak Aktar\" and \"Eleos\". \"Tamally Maak\" from Diab\\'s 2000 album became a huge success. Leily Nahari, Diab\\'s first album with Rotana Records, was released in 2004. His album El Leila De was released in the summer of 2007 and topped the Arabic music charts for 22 weeks. Diab received a World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist for the album. In 2008, Diab renewed his contract with Rotana for five more years.  In 2009, Diab released a new album Wayah. Influences and contributions Diab revolutionized Egyptian show business in several respects,  and some of his biographers have referred to him as rebellious, because he challenged everything in Middle Eastern show business, from hairstyle and appearance to music style, presentation, and the financial scale of his projects.Diab’s blending of Western rhythms with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern music styles created a new music style, referred to as Mediterranean music. His song “Tamalli Ma’ak”/“Always With You,” where he introduced classical guitar, is a good example of the genre. The world\\'s perspective Diab is one of the most popular and acclaimed Arab pop singers of the modern age.  In 1997 he won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival: one for Best Video, for Best Song, and for Best Artist of the Year. The following year Diab received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of Nour El Ain and received a World Music Award in Monaco. Albums Nour El Ain In 1996, Nour El Ain (Light of The Eye – Sight) was released, becoming a tremendous success not only in the Middle East but throughout the entire world. The song was composed by Nasser el-Mizdawi, lyrics were written by Ahmed Sheta and it was arranged by Hameed Elshaery. The title track, and its English version \"Habibi\", was an international phenomenon, becoming a massive crossover hit in countries such as Pakistan, India (performed by Nachiketa in Bengali keeping the tune and composition and replacing the lyrics with his own), Afghanistan, Sri Lanka (performed by Sangeeth Wickremasinghe) and Malaysia (Malay version sung by Datuk Sharifah Aini). The song was remade with Malayalam lyrics the movie Chandralekha. In a style reminiscent of the Aldo (musician) Franco-Arabic style, the song was remixed by several top European arrangers and has become a big pull on the dance floors of Europe. The video clip, also produced by Alam El Phan for the song \"Nour El Ain\", was one of the most lavish and expensive productions in the field of Egyptian song and set a new standard for his contemporaries to aspire to. This album sold 3 million copies.In 1997, Amr Diab won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival (for Best Video, Best Song and Artist of the Year). In the following year, he received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of Nour El Ain and received a World Music Award in Monaco on 6 May 1998, under the patronage of H.S.H. Albert II, Prince of Monaco. This award was the first of its kind for an Egyptian artist, emphasizing that his appeal is not confined to the Middle East, unlike the majority of his contemporaries. Awedoni His follow-up studio album titled Awedoni (They made me used to...) was released in July 1998 and, as with Nour El Ain, it was produced with Hamid El Shaery and recorded in Cairo, Egypt. The first video from the album, the title track \"Awedooni\", was shot by the Nile in Egypt and directed by Tareq Al Aryan. Like its predecessor, this album was a huge success for Amr and reinforced his popularity in the Arab world and abroad. Amarain Diab released his July 1999 new studio album Amarain (two moons), which is hailed as the best work of his career.  Amr is working on eagerly anticipated duets with the France-based international Rai superstar, Khaled of \"Didi\" fame, and with the Greek singer, Angela Dimitrou, whose crossover smash \"Marguerites\" was a huge hit across the Middle East in 1998. The title track \"Amarain\" was the first video to be broadcast. Tamally Ma\\'ak In July 2000, Diab revolutionized Arab music when he issued Tamally Ma\\'ak (I\\'m Always With You). The song was composed by Sherif Tag, a modern Egyptian composer. He introduced the Spanish guitar in \"Tamally Ma\\'ak\" and in other songs. The clip of this song was made in the Czech Republic with much success. The album contained songs like \"El Allem Alla\" (Only God Knows), \"Ba\\'terf\" (I Confess) which were composed by Amr Mostafa, the best Middle Eastern composer, \"Sa\\'ban Alaea\" (It Makes Me Feel Sorry) and \"We Heya Amla Eih\" (And How Is She?). The song \"Tamally Ma\\'ak\" was copied in the hit Bollywood song \"Kaho Na Kaho\" from the film Murder and also \"I\\'m Calling U\" by the group Outlandish. Aktar Wahed Aktar Wahed was released on 1 August 2001. The album\\'s name Aktar Wahed is short for one of the songs, \"Aktar Wahed Beyhebbak\" (One loves you the most). It contains 10 tracks and received the World Music Award for the best-selling album in the Middle East for 2001. Allem Albi In February 2003, Diab released Allem Alby (Teach My Heart). The album\\'s release date was arranged to be with the debut broadcast of Alam El Phan\\'s (Allem Albys production company, owned by Mohsen Gaber) music channel Mazzika.The album was a great success, with the release of the video \"Ana Ayesh\" (I\\'m Alive) which was directed by Stuart Gosling. The video was intensely broadcast on Mazzika. The album contains other songs, like the R&B-influenced hit, \"Allem Albi\". Others that tend to be more distinctively Arabic-sounding are songs like \"Kolohom\" (All of Them), \"Law Ash\\'any\" (If You Adore Me), and \"Alli El Wadaa\\'\" (Goodbye To Me). Leily Nahary In late summer 2004, Diab\\'s first album with Rotana was released: Leily Nahary (My Nights, My Days). The album\\'s cover was from the promotional photo shoot of Pepsi. The video \"Leily Nahari\" directed by Cameron Casey provided aid to give Diab his space in the record-exclusive music channels. It was criticized because of its similarity to his previously unreleased video for \"El Alem Allah\" from the album Tamally Ma\\'ak. Kammel Kalamak Diab\\'s album Kammel Kalamak, released on 14 December 2005, was the follow-up to Leily Nahary. The love ballad \"We Malo\" was released as the single of the album, Kammel Kalamak. The music video was shot in London and was released on a late notice after the release of the album. Rumors surfaced in late 2005 and early 2006 stated that Amr is considering terminating his contract with Rotana due to the poor promotion of Kammel Kalamak. El Lilady The album El Lilady (or El Leila De) was originally set to be released after Ramadan 2006. However, it was pushed back several times due to Diab\\'s repeated changes in the musical producers he was dealing with. Diab attributes the changes to the producer\\'s lack of new and strong styles. In early 2006, music arranger Fahd was supposed to work on this album; however, later that year Tarek Madkour joined Amr Diab, and they started together to work on it. On 25 March 2007, Madkour\\'s official website announced that Amr Diab and Madkour had decided jointly to skip the collaboration on the album due to the lack of time and conflicting working schedules. Fahd and new producer Hasan Al Shafei are elected to produce the music in the album, which was supposed to hit the markets in July 2007. The title of the album was changed from Khaleek Ma\\'aya to El Leila De. After the release Amr, shot a new Pepsi advertisement in Europe. On 21 June 2007, two of the biggest sites (AmrDiabWorld.com and AmrDiab.info) for Amr Diab announced that El Lilady would hit the market on 7 July 2007. The album would contain 10 tracks; Al Shafei and Fahd shared the production: Al Shaei with seven songs and Fahd with three. Before releasing his album, Diab traveled to Portugal to shoot the new Pepsi ad, choosing \"Inta El Ghaly\" song from El Leila De as the ad. Amr then traveled to the USA to film the music video for his upcoming album.The album master copy was given to Rotana, Amr Diab\\'s CD production company, on the last week of June to meet the 7 July 2007 release date he had planned. Rotana, however, delayed the release of the new CD for a couple of days for unknown reasons. The album had been leaked. The album was officially released on 11 July 2007. The album has already become a huge hit in Egypt and all over the Middle East. The video clip has been slated for a 27 July release. The song that Diab chose to film was \"N\\'eoul Eih\", which is in the new style of House Music mixed with oriental Arabic music. The video clip was filmed in Santa Monica and Malibu, and also near Hollywood. On 30 October 2007, the management of the World Music Awards announced that Amr Diab was to receive an award for best selling artist in the Middle East for this album. Amr Diab received the award in the festival that was held in Monaco, Monte Carlo, on 4 November 2007. Wayah (2009) The world music award of for the best-selling album in the Middle East 2009, Wayah (With Her) was released for sale on the internet on 27 June; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab\\'s fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies. On 18 October 2009 Amr Diab won four 2009 African Music Awards in the following categories: best artist, best album, best vocalist and best song for \"Wayah\"; Amr Diab has been nominated by the Big Apple Music Awards.  Aslaha Betefre (2010) Amr Diab released a mini-album for the first time in his career history, produced by Rotana, in July 2010. The mini album contains one song with the arrangements (original song, club mix, and karaoke). Banadeek Ta\\'ala (2011) In May 2011, it was announced that Amr Diab\\'s new album (at the time titled Heya Hayati) was slated for an Eid Al Fitr release. Due to the unstable political situation in Egypt, the album was pushed back and delayed until further notice. In late August 2011, Amr Diab\\'s official website announced the new album\\'s final title, Banadeek Ta\\'ala, and Rotana slated the album for a 28 September release. The album contains 12 songs that include \"Banadeek Ta\\'ala,\" \"Heya Hayaty,\" \"Aloomak Leh,\" \"Aref Habibi,\" \"Maly Enaya,\" \"Yaret Sennek,\" and \"Tagreba o Addet.\" The album was arranged by Adel Hakki and was produced by Rotana. Music videos Diab is one of the first singers to popularise music videos in the Arab world and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.  With the exception of his very early releases, his albums have had at least one song shot as a music video. Diab has collaborated with a variety of music video directors in the Middle East, including Tarek El-Erian and Sherif Sabri. The most anticipated video clip of 2007, \"N\\'eoul Eih\", was released on 14 August that year on Rotana TV. It was broadcast minutes later on Egyptian television on El Beit Betak. The video was a great success.6 August 2009 witnessed the release of Amr Diab\\'s latest video clip for his smash hit \"Wayah\". Working alongside Cameron Casey and [Leily Nahari] for a second time, Amr Diab presented a fresh video clip which was filmed mostly on Green Screen and in Diab\\'s personal villa in Cairo, Egypt. The biggest surprise was the appearance of Diab\\'s children alongside his niece, who represented the younger generation of children who are inspired by the music of Amr Diab. Diab also filmed \"Ba2dem Alby\" which was released on Valentine\\'s Day. El Helm/The Dream The Dream or El Helm is a biographical TV production produced by Amr Afefy that gives viewers the story of Amr Diab\\'s life. The show consists of 12 episodes and began airing on 24 December 2008. El Helm is narrated by actor Ezzat Abou Ouf and includes interviews with Diab and people he worked with throughout the span of his career. The show, which aired on Rotana TV, saw great success and was preceded by one of the biggest advertising campaigns in the history of Middle Eastern music. Film career Diab\\'s fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, El Afareet, which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film Ice Cream in Gleam (Ays Krim fi Glym), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive\\'s new program \"Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films\" at James Bridges Theater, UCLA,  6, 8 and 10 April. David Chute of the Los Angeles Weekly termed it \"observant\" and \"a big leap\".  His third movie was released in 1993, and was named Deahk We La\\'ab (Laughter and Fun). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star Omar Sharif (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago) and Yousra. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career. Egyptian Revolution A few days after former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, \"Masr A\\'let\" (Egypt Said Its Word),  and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the uprising. He also initiated a charity campaign \"Masry Begad\" (\"Real Egyptian\"), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.  Endorsements Amr Diab has taken part in an internationally known Pepsi commercial featuring four other pop musicians: Beyoncé Knowles, Pink, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears. In the US version, Enrique Iglesias takes the role of Caesar. But in the pan Arab version, the three American singers were retained but the male figure was replaced with Diab. This was not the first Pepsi commercial Diab has done; he also filmed commercials featuring his songs \"Ana Aktar Wahed\" (I\\'m the most), \"Allem Alby\" (teach my heart) and \"Khad Alby Ma\\'aa\" (She took my heart with her). Diab also appeared in a commercial alongside Jennifer Lopez, singing The Troggs hit \"Wild Thing\". In 2009 Pepsi decided not to renew his contract. In 2010 he was the star of \"Hayat\" bottled water campaign. Local record labels Diab\\'s earliest albums were released by Delta Sound. In 1996 Diab moved to Alam Al Phan where he released his greatest hits. In between 2003 and 2004, and after a long successful career with Alam El Phan, Diab officially announced the termination of his contract with Mohsen Gaber (owner of Alam El Phan) and move to the company that owned by Prince El Waleed Ebn Talal, Rotana Records and the owner of part of media huge muscel [Fox].

It comprises fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, Cladocera, Notostraca and the Devonian Lepidocaris. They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus, with the exception of the Cladocera, many of which are marine. DescriptionMembers of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of gills on many of the animals\\' appendages, including some of the mouthparts. This is also responsible for the name of the group  (from the  , gills, akin to  , windpipe;  , foot).  They generally possess compound eyes and a carapace, which may be a shell of two valves enclosing the trunk (as in most Cladocera), broad and shallow (as in the Notostraca), or entirely absent (as in the Anostraca).    In the groups where the carapace prevents the use of the trunk limbs for swimming (Cladocera, clam shrimp and the extinct Lipostraca), the antennae are used for locomotion, as they are in the nauplius.  Male fairy shrimp have an enlarged pair of antennae with which they grasp the female during mating, while the bottom-feeding Notostraca, the antennae are reduced to vestiges.  The trunk limbs are beaten in a metachronal rhythm, causing a flow of water along the midline of the animal, from which it derives oxygen, food and, in the case of the Anostraca and Notostraca, movement.  EcologyAmong the branchiopods, only some cladocerans are marine; all the other groups are found in continental waters fresh water, including temporary pools and salt lakes.  Most branchiopodans eat floating detritus or plankton, which they take using the setae on their appendages.  TaxonomyIn early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, Monoculus. The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by Pierre André Latreille in 1817, initially at the rank of order.  Anostraca   The fairy shrimp of the order Anostraca are usually   long (exceptionally up to  ).  Most species have 20 body segments, bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like phyllopodia (swimming legs), and the body lacks a carapace.    They live in vernal pools and hypersaline lakes across the world, including pools in deserts, in ice-covered mountain lakes and in Antarctica. They swim \"upside-down\" and feed by filtering organic particles from the water or by scraping algae from surfaces.  They are an important food for many birds and fish, and are cultured and harvested for use as fish food.    There are 300 species spread across 8 families.    Lipostraca  Lipostraca contains a single species, Lepidocaris rhyniensis,  which is the most abundant animal in the Rhynie chert desposits.  It resembles modern Anostraca, to which it is probably closely related, although its relationships to other orders remain unclear.  The body is   long, with 23 body segments and 19 pairs of appendages, but no carapace.  It occurred chiefly among charophytes, probably in alkaline temporary pools.    Notostraca  The order Notostraca comprises the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp.    The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic.  They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes.  The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs.  The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami.  Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction.  Notostracans are the largest branchiopodans and are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.  Laevicaudata, Spinicaudata and Cyclestherida  Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the Devonian. The three groups are not believed to form a clade. They have 10–32 trunk segments, decreasing in size from front to back, and each bears a pair of legs which also carry gills. A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together. Cladocera   Cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas. Around 620 species have been recognised so far, with many more undescribed.      They are ubiquitous in inland aquatic habitats, but rare in the oceans.    Most are   long, with a down-turned head, and a carapace covering the apparently unsegmented thorax and abdomen.    There is a single median compound eye.  Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction, which produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats.    EvolutionThe fossil record of branchiopods extends back at least into the Upper Cambrian and possibly further. The group is thought to be monophyletic, with the Anostraca having been the first group to branch off.    It is thought that the group evolved in the seas, but was forced into temporary pools and hypersaline lakes by the evolution of bony fishes.  Although they were previously considered the sister group to the remaining crustaceans, it is now widely accepted that crustaceans form a paraphyletic group, and Branchiopoda are thought to be sister to a clade comprising Xenocarida (Remipedia and Cephalocarida) and Hexapoda (insects and their relatives).

The referenced n-gon in the name of the bipyramids is not an external face but an internal one, existing on the primary symmetry plane which connects the two pyramid halves.The face-transitive bipyramids are the dual polyhedra of the uniform prisms and will generally have isosceles triangle faces.A bipyramid can be projected on a sphere or globe as n equally spaced lines of longitude going from pole to pole, and bisected by a line around the equator.Bipyramid faces, projected as spherical triangles, represent the fundamental domains in the dihedral symmetry D nh . VolumeThe volume of a bipyramid is  \\\\scriptstyle{V =} \\\\tfrac{2}{3} \\\\scriptstyle{Bh}  where B is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex. This works for any location of the apex, provided that h is measured as the perpendicular distance from the plane which contains the base.The volume of a bipyramid whose base is a regular n-sided polygon with side length s and whose height is h is therefore:   V = \\\\frac{n}{6}hs^2 \\\\cot\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{n}.  Equilateral triangle bipyramidsOnly three kinds of bipyramids can have all edges of the same length (which implies that all faces are equilateral triangles, and thus the bipyramid is a deltahedron): the triangular, tetragonal, and pentagonal bipyramids. The tetragonal bipyramid with identical edges, or regular octahedron, counts among the Platonic solids, while the triangular and pentagonal bipyramids with identical edges count among the Johnson solids (J12 and J13).

Her Roman equivalent is the goddess  .According to Hesiod\\'s Theogony, she was born when Cronus cut off Uranus\\'s genitals and threw them into the sea, and she arose from the sea foam (aphros).   According to Homer\\'s Iliad, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione.Because of her beauty, other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, so Zeus married her to Hephaestus, who, because of his ugliness and deformity, was not seen as a threat. Aphrodite had many lovers—both gods, such as Ares, and men, such as Anchises. She played a role in the Eros and Psyche legend, and later was both Adonis\\'s lover and his surrogate mother. Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite. Aphrodite is also known as Cytherea (Lady of Cythera) and Cypris (Lady of Cyprus) after the two cult sites, Cythera and Cyprus, which claimed to be her place of birth.  Myrtle, doves, sparrows, horses, and swans were said to be sacred to her. The ancient Greeks identified her with the Ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor. Reginald Eldred Witt, Isis in the ancient world (Johns Hopkins University Press) 1997:125. ISBN 0-8018-5642-6 Aphrodite had many other names, such as Acidalia, Cytherea and Cerigo, each used by a different local cult of the goddess in Greece. The Greeks recognized all of these names as referring to the single goddess Aphrodite, despite the slight differences in what these local cults believed the goddess demanded of them. The Attic philosophers of the fourth century, however, drew a distinction between a celestial Aphrodite (Aprodite Urania) of transcendent principles, and a separate, \"common\" Aphrodite who was the goddess of the people (Aphrodite Pandemos). EtymologyThe archaic (Homeric) pronunciation of the name   was approximately  . In Koine Greek, this became  , changing further to   in Byzantine Greek by iotacism. The most common English pronunciation of Aphrodite is  .The etymology of Greek   is unknown.Hesiod connects it with   (aphros) \"foam,\" interpreting it as \"risen from the foam\". Other possible etymologies, many of them not Greek, have been suggested in scholarship. However, Janda (2010) considers the connection with \"foam\" genuine, and points to the story of Aphrodite\\'s birth, in which she arises from the sea foam after Cronus defeats Uranus, as a mytheme of Proto-Indo-European age.According to this interpretation, the name is from aphrós \"foam\" and déatai \"[she] seems\" or \"shines\" (infinitive form *déasthai ), meaning \"she who shines from the foam [ocean]\", a byname of the dawn goddess (Eos). Janda, Michael, Die Musik nach dem Chaos, Innsbruck 2010, p. 65  J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams (1997)  have also proposed an etymology based on the connection with the Indo-European dawn goddess, from   \"very\" and   \"to shine\".A number of possible non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship.The connection to Phoenician religion claimed by Herodotus (I.105,131) has inspired attempts to show that the Greek Aphrodite is derived from a Semitic word, Aštoret, by way of a hypothetical Hittite transmission, but these attempts have been inconclusive.Another proposed Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian barīrītu, the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. The name probably means \"she who (comes) at dusk,\" which would be an appropriate appellation for Aphrodite, given her role as the personification of the evening star—a role that, significantly, she shares with a parallell Mesopotamian goddess, Ishtar.Another non-Greek etymology, suggested by M. Hammarström,   looks to Etruscan, comparing (e)pruni \"lord\", an Etruscan  honorific loaned into Greek as πρύτανις. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, \"the lady\".  Hjalmar Frisk rejects this etymology as implausible.The learned medieval work Etymologicum Magnum offers a pseudoetymology claiming that \"Aphrodite\" is derived from the compound   habrodiaitos (\"she who lives delicately\" from   habros +   diaita). The alteration from b to ph is explained as a \"familiar\" characteristic of Greek \"obvious from the Macedonians\".  Mythology Birth Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship,  Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called \"Cyprian\", especially in the poetic works of Sappho. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, \"Cytherea\".  Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite\\'s cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.In the most famous version of her myth, her birth was the consequence of a castration: Cronus severed Uranus\\' genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, meaning \"foam-arisen\"), while the Erinyes (furies) emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals \"were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.\" The girl, Aphrodite, floated ashore on a scallop shell. This iconic representation of Aphrodite as a mature \"Venus rising from the sea\" (Venus Anadyomene ) was made famous in a much-admired painting by Apelles, now lost, but described in the Natural History of Pliny the Elder.In another version of her origin,  she was considered a daughter of Zeus and Dione, the mother goddess whose oracle was at Dodona. Aphrodite herself was sometimes also referred to as \"Dione\". \"Dione\" seems to be a feminine form of \"Dios\", the genitive form case of Zeus, and could be taken to mean simply \"the goddess\" in a generic sense. Aphrodite might, then, be an equivalent of Rhea, the Earth Mother, whom Homer relocated to Olympus. In Homer, Aphrodite ventures into battle to protect her son, Aeneas, is wounded by Diomedesk and returns to her mother to sink down at her knee and be comforted. AdulthoodAphrodite is consistently portrayed, in every image and story, as having had no childhood, and instead being born as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult. She is often depicted nude. In many of the later myths, she is portrayed as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Although she is married—she is one of the few gods in the Greek Pantheon who is—she is frequently unfaithful to her husband. Aphrodite\\'s husband Hephaestus is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities, but in the Odyssey she is portrayed as preferring Ares, the volatile god of war because she is attracted to his violent nature. Aphrodite is one of a few characters in the Odyssey  whose actions are a major contributing cause of the Trojan War: she offers Helen of Troy to Paris, and as the goddess of desire, she is responsible for Paris becoming so inflamed with desire for Helen at first sight that he is moved to abduct her.According to one version of Aphrodite\\'s story, because of her immense beauty Zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her. To forestall this, he forces her to marry Hephaestus, the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of the story, Aphrodite marries Hephaestus after his mother, Hera casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite\\'s hand in marriage. Hephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forges her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a girdle that makes her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage causes Aphrodite to seek other male companionship, most often Ares, but also sometimes  Adonis. AdonisAphrodite was Adonis\\' lover and a surrogate mother to him. Cinyras, the King of Cyprus, had an intoxicatingly beautiful daughter named Myrrha. When Myrrha\\'s mother commits hubris against Aphrodite by claiming her daughter is more beautiful than the famed goddess, Myrrha is punished with a never-ending lust for her own father. Cinyras is repulsed by this, but Myrrha disguises herself as a prostitute, and secretly sleeps with her father at night. Eventually, Myrrha becomes pregnant and is discovered by Cinyras. In a rage, he chases her out of the house with a knife. Myrrha flees from him, praying to the gods for mercy as she runs. The gods hear her plea, and change her into a myrrh tree so her father cannot kill her. Eventually, Cinyras takes his own life in an attempt to restore the family\\'s honor.Myrrha gives birth to a baby boy named Adonis. Aphrodite happens by the myrrh tree and, seeing him, takes pity on the infant. She places Adonis in a box, and takes him down to Hades so Persephone can care for him. Adonis grows into a strikingly handsome young man, and Aphrodite eventually returns for him. Persephone, however, is loath to give him up, and wishes Adonis would stay with her in the underworld. The two goddesses begin such a quarrel, Zeus is forced to intercede. He decrees that Adonis will spend a third of the year with Aphrodite, a third of the year with Persephone, and a third of the year with whomever he wishes. Adonis, of course, chooses Aphrodite.Adonis begins his year on the earth with Aphrodite. One of his greatest passions is hunting, and although Aphrodite is not naturally a hunter, she takes up the sport just so she can be with him. They spend every waking hour with one another, and Aphrodite is enraptured with him. However, her anxiety begins to grow over her neglected duties, and she is forced to leave him for a short time. Before she leaves, she gives Adonis one warning: do not attack an animal which shows no fear. Adonis agrees to her advice, but, secretly doubting her skills as a huntress, quickly forgets her warning.Not long after Aphrodite leaves, Adonis comes across an enormous wild boar, much larger than any he has ever seen. It is suggested that the boar is the god Ares, one of Aphrodite\\'s lovers made jealous through her constant doting on Adonis. Although boars are dangerous and will charge a hunter if provoked, Adonis disregards Aphrodite\\'s warning and pursues the giant creature. Soon, however, Adonis is the one being pursued; he is no match for the giant boar. In the attack, Adonis is castrated by the boar, and dies from a loss of blood. Aphrodite rushes back to his side, but she is too late to save him and can only mourn over his body. Wherever Adonis\\' blood falls, Aphrodite causes anemones to grow in his memory. She vows that on the anniversary of his death, every year there will be a festival held in his honor.On his death, Adonis goes back to the underworld, and Persephone is delighted to see him again. Eventually, Aphrodite realizes he is there, and rushes back to retrieve him. Again, she and Persephone bicker over who is allowed to keep Adonis until Zeus intervenes. This time, he says Adonis must spend six months with Aphrodite and six months with Persephone, the way it should have been in the first place. The Judgement of Paris The gods and goddesses, as well as various mortals, were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only the goddess Eris (Discord) was not invited, but she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word kallistēi (\"to the fairest one\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida (where Troy was situated), the goddesses appeared before Paris. Paris, having been given permission by Zeus to set any conditions he saw fit, required the goddesses to undress and allow him to see them naked. (Another version of the myth says the goddesses themselves chose to undress.) Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all Asia and Europe, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. The other two goddesses were enraged by this, and through Helen\\'s abduction by Paris, they brought about the Trojan War.

He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for Artemis and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her.In the most popular version of the story, as told in the play Hippolytus by Euripides, Phaedra seeks revenge against Hippolytus by killing herself and, in her suicide note, tells Theseus, her husband and Hippolytus\\' father, that Hippolytus had raped her. Hippolytus was oath-bound not to mention Phaedra\\'s love for him and nobly refused to defend himself despite the consequences. Theseus then cursed his son, a curse Poseidon was bound to fulfill, so Hippolytus was laid low by a bull from the sea that caused his chariot-team to panic and wreck his vehicle. Hippolytus forgives his father before he dies and Artemis reveals the truth to Theseus before vowing to kill the one Aphrodite loves (Adonis) for revenge.Glaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite. When he was competing in the chariot race at the funeral games of King Pelias she drove his horses mad and they tore him apart. His ghost was said to frighten horses during the Isthmian Games. In one Greek myth, Aphrodite placed the curse of snakes for hair and the stone-gaze upon Medusa and her sisters. Aphrodite was jealous of the three sisters\\' beauty, and she grew so jealous, she cursed them. Forms of Aphrodite  By the late 5th century BC, certain philosophers had begun to draw a distinction between two separate \"Aphrodites\" (as opposed to a single Aphrodite whose characteristics varied slightly in different local cults of the goddess): Aphrodite Ourania, the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and Aphrodite Pandemos, the common Aphrodite \"of all the folk\", born from the union of Zeus and Dione.  Among the neo-Platonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love. (We know of this representation, said to have been a chryselephantine sculpture made by Phidias for Elis, only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias). Plato, in his Symposium,  has one of his characters, an Athenian named Pausanias (no relation to the geographer Pausanias), describe Aphrodite as two goddesses, one older, the other younger. The older one, Urania, is the daughter of Uranus, and inspires homosexual male (and more specifically, ephebic) love/eros; the younger is named Pandemos, the daughter of Zeus and Dione, and all love for women comes from her. The speech of Pausanias distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania (\"heavenly\" Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos (\"Common\" Aphrodite). Aphrodite is also known as Areia , showing her connection to Ares, the god of war, whom she had extramarital relations with. As a result, she was, to some extent, made into a goddess of war. This is especially true in Sparta. Comparative mythology Ancient Near Eastern parallelsThe religions of the Ancient Near East have a number of love goddesses that can be argued to be similar to certain aspects of Aphrodite.Her cult in Greece was imported from, or influenced by, the cult of Astarte in Phoenicia.Hans Georg Wunderlich further connects Aphrodite with the Minoan snake goddess. The Egyptian snake goddess Wadjet was associated with the city known to the Greeks as Aphroditopolis (the city of Aphrodite). Pausanias states the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians the Paphians of Cyprus and then the Phoenicians at Ascalon. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of Cythera. An origin of (or significant influence on) the Greek love goddess from Near Eastern traditions was seen with some skepticism in classical 19th century scholarship. Authors such as A. Enmann (Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development.Scholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to Walter Burkert (1984), and the significant influence of the Near East on early Greek religion in general (and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular) is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eightth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In native Greek tradition, the planet had two names, Hesperos as the evening star and Eosphoros as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening stars, as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite, during the fourth century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology, such as the zodiac (Eudoxus of Cnidus). Comparison with the Indo-European dawn goddessIt has long been accepted in comparative mythology that Aphrodite (regardless of possible oriental influences) preserves some aspects of the Indo-European dawn goddess  (properly Greek Eos, Latin  Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Janda (2010) etymologizes her name as \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod\\'s Theogony account of Aphrodite\\'s birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.  Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme   would then be directly cognate to the Rigvedic myth of Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas.  Cult of AphroditeThe epithet Aphrodite Acidalia was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used for bathing, located in Boeotia (Virgil I, 720).  She was also called Kypris or Cytherea after her birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively, both centers of her cult. She was associated with Hesperia and frequently accompanied by the Oreads, nymphs of the mountains. Her festival, Aphrodisia, was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in Athens and Corinth. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of Acrocorinth (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC), intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was re-established under Roman rule in 44 BC, but the fertility rituals likely continued in the main city near the agora.Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with, the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, pomegranates, sceptres, apples, myrtle, rose trees, lime trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.One aspect of the cult of Aphrodite and her precedents that Thomas Bulfinch\\'s much-reprinted The Age of Fable; or Stories of Gods and Heroes (1855 etc.) elided  was the practice of ritual prostitution in her shrines and temples. The euphemism in Greek is hierodoule, \"sacred slave.\" The practice was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite\\'s Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian Inanna and Akkadian Ishtar, whose temple priestesses were the \"women of Ishtar,\" ishtaritum.  The practice has been documented in Babylon, Syria and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the Tyrian colony Carthage, and for Hellenic Aphrodite in Cyprus, the center of her cult, Cythera, Corinth and in Sicily (Marcovich 1996:49); the practice however is not attested in Athens. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the hetaera and courtesan. In Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor, hierodoulai served in the temple of Artemis.

It consists of the Jutland peninsula and several islands in the Baltic sea, referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) Schleswig-Holstein to the south.Denmark borders both the Baltic and North Seas along its   tidal shoreline. Denmark\\'s general coastline is muc69h shorter, at  , as it would, among other geographical features, not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180\\xa0km long Limfjorden, which separates Denmark\\'s second largest island, North Jutlandic Island, 4,686\\xa0km 2  in size, from the rest of Jutland. Denmark has 443 named islands,  of which 72 are inhabited ( , Statistics Denmark). Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat wi69th a few gently rolling plains. The territory of Denmark includes the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the Danish Straits (Skagerrak and Kattegat) linking Baltic and North Seas. The country\\'s natural resources include petroleum, natural gas, fish, salt, limestone, stone, gravel and sand. Environment  Land use [[%  5% 1993 est.) est.)

It is the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In scientific contexts the Btu has largely been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule.The unit is most often used as a measure of power (as Btu/h) in the power, steam generation, heating and air conditioning industries, and also as a measure of agricultural energy production (Btu/kg).  It is still used in metric English-speaking countries (such as Canada), and remains the standard unit of classification for air conditioning units manufactured and sold in many non-English-speaking metric countries.  In North America, the term \"Btu\" is used to describe the heat value (energy content) of fuels. DefinitionsA Btu is defined as amount of heat required to raise the temperature of   of liquid water by   at a constant pressure of one atmosphere.  As is the case with the calorie, several different definitions of the Btu exist, which are based on different water temperatures and therefore vary by up to 0.5%. A Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden match  or as the amount of energy it would take to lift a one-pound weight to a height of  .

This is easily confused with the SI mega (M) prefix, which multiplies by a factor of one million (1,000,000). To avoid confusion many companies and engineers use MMBtu to represent one million Btu. Alternatively a therm is used representing 100,000 or 10 5 \\xa0Btu, and a quad as 10 15 \\xa0Btu. Some companies also use BtuE6 in order to reduce confusion between a thousand Btu vs. a million Btu.  ConversionsOne Btu is approximately: 1.054 to 1.060 kJ (kilojoules) 0.293071 W·h (watt hours) 252 to 253\\xa0cal (calories, or \"little calories\") 0.25 kcal (kilocalories, \"large calories,\" or \"food calories\") 25\\xa0031 to 25\\xa0160\\xa0ft·pdl (foot-poundal) 778 to 782\\xa0ft·lbf (foot-pounds-force) 5.40395 (lbf/in 2 )·ft 3  For natural gas In natural gas, by convention 1\\xa0MMBtu (1 million Btu) = 1.054615\\xa0GJ.

So, 1\\xa0MMBtu = 28.263682\\xa0m 3  (998.12\\xa0ft 3 ) of natural gas at defined temperature and pressure. 1 standard cubic foot of natural gas yields ≈ 1030\\xa0Btu (between 1010\\xa0Btu and 1070\\xa0Btu, depending on quality, when burned) As a coarse approximation, 1000\\xa0ft 3  of natural gas ≈ 1\\xa0MMBtu ≈ 1\\xa0GJ As a unit of powerWhen used as a unit of power for heating and cooling systems, Btu per hour (Btu/h) is the correct unit, though this is often abbreviated to just \"Btu\". . 1 watt is approximately 3.41214\\xa0Btu/h  1000\\xa0Btu/h is approximately 293.071\\xa0W 1 horsepower is approximately 2,544\\xa0Btu/h Associated units 1 \"ton of cooling,\" a common unit in North American refrigeration and air conditioning applications, is 12,000\\xa0Btu/h.

Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.  One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts. The Btu should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy (1\\xa0kW·h, or about 3412\\xa0Btu).The Btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants. Figures are quoted in terms of the quantity of heat in Btu required to generate 1\\xa0kW·h of electrical energy. A typical coal-fired power plant works at 10,500\\xa0Btu/kW·h, an efficiency of 32–33%.

It operates as a network comprising both a multinational, stateless army  . \"Al-Qaeda\\'s global network, as we know it today, was created while it was based in Khartoum, from December 1991 till May 1996. To coordinate its overt and covert operations as al-Qaeda\\'s ambitions and resources increased, it developed a decentralized, regional structure. [...] As a global multinational, al-Qaeda makes its constituent nationalities and ethnic groups, of which there are several dozen, responsible for a particular geographic region. Although its modus operandi is cellular, familial relationships play a key role.\"  See also:    and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global Jihad and a strict interpretation of sharia law. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and various other countries (see below). Al-Qaeda has carried out several attacks on non-Muslims,   and other targets it considers kafir.  Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries, including the September 11 attacks, 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and the 2002 Bali bombings. The U.S. government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror. With the loss of key leaders, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda\\'s operations have devolved from  actions that were controlled from the top-down, to actions by franchise associated groups, to actions of lone wolf operators.Characteristic techniques employed by al-Qaeda include suicide attacks and simultaneous bombings of different targets.  Activities ascribed to it may involve members of the movement, who have taken a pledge of loyalty to Osama bin Laden, or the much more numerous \"al-Qaeda-linked\" individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq or Sudan, but who have not taken any pledge.  Al-Qaeda ideologues envision a complete break from all foreign influences in Muslim countries, and the creation of a new world-wide Islamic caliphate.    Among the beliefs ascribed to Al-Qaeda members is the conviction that a Christian–Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam.  As Salafist jihadists, they believe that the killing of civilians is religiously sanctioned, and they ignore any aspect of religious scripture which might be interpreted as forbidding the murder of civilians and internecine fighting.     Al-Qaeda also opposes man-made laws, and wants to replace them with a strict form of sharia law.   Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among Muslims.  Al-Qaeda is intolerant of non-Sunni branches of Islam and denounces them by means of excommunications called \"takfir\". Al-Qaeda leaders regard liberal Muslims, Shias, Sufis and other sects as heretics and have attacked their mosques and gatherings.  Examples of sectarian attacks include the Yazidi community bombings, the Sadr City bombings, the Ashoura Massacre and the April 2007 Baghdad bombings.  OrganizationAl-Qaeda\\'s management philosophy has been described as \"centralization of decision and decentralization of execution.\"  It is thought that al-Qaeda\\'s leadership, following the War on Terror, has \"become geographically isolated\", leading to the \"emergence of decentralized leadership\" of regional groups using the al-Qaeda \"brand\".  Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda\\'s leadership. Although bin Laden still held considerable ideological sway over some Muslim extremists before his death, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another. Marc Sageman, a psychiatrist and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, said that al-Qaeda is now just a \"loose label for a movement that seems to target the West\". \"There is no umbrella organisation. We like to create a mythical entity called [al-Qaeda] in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.\"   This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni: \"...this matter isn\\'t about any specific person and...is not about the al-Qai`dah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one...and all the true believers [mu\\'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn\\'t like the West portrays it, that there is an \\'organization\\' with a specific name (such as \\'al-Qai`dah\\') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called \\'The Base\\' [\\'Al-Qai`dah\\'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren\\'t separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.\"    Others, however, see al-Qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said \"It amazes me that people don\\'t think there is a clear adversary out there, and that our adversary does not have a strategic approach.\" Al-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:   Al-Qaeda in Iraq Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb Al-Shabaab (Mujahideen Youth Movement) in Somalia Egyptian Islamic Jihad Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which comprises Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, and Islamic Jihad of Yemen   Leadership Information mostly acquired from Jamal al-Fadl provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.  . Osama bin Laden was the most historically notable emir, or commander, and Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaida prior to his assassination on May 1, 2011 by US forces. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda\\'s Deputy Operations Chief prior to bin Laden\\'s death, assumed the role of commander, according to an announcement by al-Qaida on June 16, 2011. He replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander. Bin Laden was advised by a Shura Council, which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials to consist of 20–30 people.Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011. On 5 June 2012, Pakistan intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman\\'s replacement Abu Yahya al-Libi had been killed in Pakistan. Al-Qaeda\\'s network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network that draws on leaders of all its regional nodes \"as and when necessary to serve as an integral part of its high command.\"  The Military Committee is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks. The Money/Business Committee funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system. U.S-led efforts to eradicate the sources of terrorist financing  were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks;  al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to $10\\xa0million.  It also provides air tickets and false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses. Businesses are run from below, with the council only being consulted on new proposals and collecting funds.  See:  .  In the 9/11 Commission Report, it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30\\xa0million-per-year to conduct its operations. The Law Committee reviews Sharia law, and decides whether particular courses of action conform to it. The Islamic Study/Fatwah Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans. In the late 1990s there was a publicly known Media Committee, which ran the now-defunct newspaper Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast) and handled public relations. In 2005, al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab, a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials. Command structureWhen asked about the possibility of al-Qaeda\\'s connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings in 2005, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: \"Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working ... but this has the hallmark of that approach ... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training ... to provide expertise ... and I think that is what has occurred here.\"   On August 13, 2005, however, The Independent newspaper, quoting police and MI5 investigations, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad. What exactly al-Qaeda is, or was, remains in dispute. Author and journalist Adam Curtis argues that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contends the name \"al-Qaeda\" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa: The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term \"al-Qaeda\" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it. The Power of Nightmares, BBC Documentary.  As a matter of law, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also known as the RICO statutes. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, who said he was a founding member of the organization and a former employee of bin Laden.  Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl\\'s testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack U.S. military establishments.   Sam Schmidt, one of his defense lawyers, said: There were selective portions of al-Fadl\\'s testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.   Field operativesThe number of individuals in the organization who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.  .  As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders. According to the award-winning 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.  Insurgent forcesAccording to Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet-Afghan war.  It was made up primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad. Another group, approximately 10,000 strong, live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training. Other analysts have described al-Qaeda\\'s rank and file as being \"predominantly Arab,\" in its first years of operation, and now also includes  \"other peoples\" as of 2007.  It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.  FinancingSome financing for al-Qaeda in the 1990s came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden. Who is Bin Laden? retrieved May 5, 2011  By 2001 Afghanistan had become politically complex and mired. With many financial sources for al-Qaeda Bin Laden\\'s financing role may have become comparatively minor. Sources in 2001 could also have included Jamaa Al-Islamiyya and Islamic Jihad, both associated with Afghan-based Egyptians.  Other sources of income in 2001 included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.  A WikiLeaks released memo from the United States Secretary of State sent in 2009 asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia.  StrategyOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel\\'s document \"Al Quaeda\\'s Strategy to the Year 2020\".     Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression: Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on U.S. soil that results in massive civilian casualties. Incite local resistance to occupying forces. Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the U.S. and its allies in a long war of attrition. Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the U.S. and countries allied with the U.S. until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings. The U.S. economy will finally collapse by the year 2020 under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places, making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the U.S. also collapse leading to global political instability, which in turn leads to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda and a Wahhabi Caliphate will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the U.S. and the rest of the Western world countries. Atwan also noted, regarding the collapse of the U.S., \"If this sounds far-fetched, it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the Soviet Union.\"  EtymologyIn Arabic, al-Qaeda has four syllables ( ,   or  ). However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name (the voiceless uvular plosive   and the voiced pharyngeal fricative  ) are not phones found in the English language, the closest naturalized English pronunciations include  ,   and  .  al-Qaeda\\'s name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa\\'ida, el-Qaida, or al-Qaeda. The name comes from the Arabic noun qā\\'idah, which means foundation or basis, and can also refer to a military base. The initial al- is the Arabic definite article the, hence the base. Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:  The name \\'al-Qaeda\\' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia\\'s terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.  It has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term \"al-Qaeda\". Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as \"the database\", and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.  In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa\\'idat al-Jihad, which means \"the base of Jihad\". According to Diaa Rashwan, this was \"apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt\\'s al-Jihad (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.\"  Ideology    The radical Islamist movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the Islamic revival and Islamist movement of the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.Some have argued that \"without the writings\" of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb, \"al-Qaeda would not have existed.\"  Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah.To restore Islam, he said a vanguard movement of righteous Muslims was needed to establish \"true Islamic states\", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like socialism and nationalism. Enemies of Islam in Qutb\\'s view included \"treacherous Orientalists\"  and \"world Jewry\", who plotted \"conspiracies\" and \"wicked[ly]\" opposed Islam.In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden:  Islam is different from any other religion; it\\'s a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.  Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden\\'s mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda,  Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri\\'s uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb\\'s student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. \"Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb\\'s character and the torment he had endured in prison.\"  Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet\\'s Banner. One of the most powerful of Qutb\\'s ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not. Rather, they were apostates. That not only gave jihadists \"a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim,\" but made \"it a religious obligation to execute\" these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.  Religious compatibilityAbdel Bari Atwan writes that:   History  Researchers   have described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: the beginning in the late 1980s, the \"wilderness\" period in 1990–96, its \"heyday\" in 1996–2001, the network period of 2001–05, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today.  Jihad in Afghanistan  The origins of al-Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the Soviet War in Afghanistan (December 1979 – February 1989).  The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, with the Afghan Marxists and allied Soviet troops on one side and the native Afghan mujahideen, some of whom were radical Islamic militants, on the other, as a blatant case of Soviet expansionism and aggression. A CIA program called Operation Cyclone channeled funds through Pakistan\\'s Inter-Services Intelligence agency to the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviet occupation.   At the same time, a growing number of Arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the Afghan Marxist regime, facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the Maktab al-Khidamat,    which was funded by the Saudi Arabia government as well as by individual Muslims (particularly Saudi businessmen who were approached by bin Laden). Together, these sources donated some $600\\xa0million a year to jihad.  In 1984 Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK), or the \"Services Office\", a Muslim organization founded to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign mujahideen for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, was established in Peshawar, Pakistan, by bin Laden and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the Muslim Brotherhood. MAK organized guest houses in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. Bin Laden became a \"major financier\" of the mujahideen, spending his own money and using his connections with \"the Saudi royal family and the petro-billionaires of the Gulf\" to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds.  From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the U.S., the hub of which was the Al Kifah Refugee Center at the Farouq Mosque on Brooklyn\\'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were \"double agent\" Ali Mohamed, whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called \"bin Laden\\'s first trainer,\"  and \"Blind Sheikh\" Omar Abdel-Rahman, a leading recruiter of mujahideen for Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda evolved from MAK.Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987. U.S. government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial. Aid to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan mujahideen leader. and founder and leader of the Hezb-e Islami radical Islamic militant faction, alone amounted \"by the most conservative estimates\" to $600\\xa0million. Later, in the early 1990s, after the U.S. had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar \"worked closely\" with bin Laden.  In addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion\\'s share of Saudi aid.  There is evidence that the CIA supported Hekmatyar\\'s drug trade activities by giving him immunity for his opium trafficking, which financed the operation of his militant faction. Interview with Alfred McCoy, November 9, 1991 by Paul DeRienzo  MAK and foreign mujahideen volunteers, or \"Afghan Arabs,\" did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan mujahideen fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign mujahideen in the field at any one time.  Nonetheless, foreign mujahideen volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.    Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers.  The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. To the surprise of many, Mohammad Najibullah\\'s communist Afghan government hung on for three more years, before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen. With mujahideen leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, chaos ensued, with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill-defined territories, leaving the country devastated. Expanding operations    Toward the end of the Soviet military mission in Afghanistan, some mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Israel and Kashmir. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations.One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988.   Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one\\'s superiors. According to Wright, the group\\'s real name wasn\\'t used in public pronouncements because \"its existence was still a closely held secret.\"  His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between \"several senior leaders\" of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden\\'s money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.  . Bin Laden wished to establish non-military operations in other parts of the world; Azzam, in contrast, wanted to remain focused on military campaigns. After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden\\'s organization.In November 1989, Ali Mohamed, a former special forces Sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became \"deeply involved with bin Laden\\'s plans.\" A year later, on November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of Ali Mohammed\\'s associate El Sayyid Nosair, discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers.  Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane on November 5, 1990. In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden\\'s relocation to Sudan.  Gulf War and the start of U.S. enmity Following the Soviet Union\\'s withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world\\'s most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam\\'s call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia\\'s own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden\\'s offer, opting instead to allow U.S. and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory. The deployment angered Bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the \"land of the two mosques\" (Mecca and Medina) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan. SudanFrom around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician Hassan al Turabi. The move followed an Islamist coup d\\'état in Sudan, led by Colonel Omar al-Bashir, who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established camps where insurgents trained.A key turning point for bin Laden, further pitting him against the Sauds, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the Oslo Accords, which set a path for peace between Israel and Palestinians. Zawahiri and the EIJ, who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government, had bad luck in Sudan. In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, Atef Sedki. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad\\'s members and executed 6. Due to bin Laden\\'s continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994 Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden\\'s passport; bin Laden\\'s Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend, $7\\xa0million ($  today) a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.     His family publicly disowned him. There is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and/or the Saudi government.   In June 1995 an even more ill-fated attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.According to Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz, the Sudanese government offered the Clinton Administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Those opportunities were met positively by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but spurned when Susan Rice and counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke persuaded National Security Advisor Sandy Berger to overrule Albright. Ijaz’s claims appeared in numerous Op-Ed pieces, including one in the Los Angeles Times  and one in The Washington Post co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan Timothy M. Carney.  Similar allegations have been made by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose,  and Richard Miniter, author of Losing bin Laden, in a November 2003 interview with World. Several sources dispute Ijaz\\'s claim, including the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the U.S. (the 9–11 Commission), which concluded in part:  Sudan\\'s minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the U.S. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.   Refuge in Afghanistan After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various mujahideen groups.Throughout the 1990s, a new force began to emerge. The origins of the Taliban (literally \"students\") lay in the children of Afghanistan, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools (madrassas) either in Kandahar or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.According to Ahmed Rashid, five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of Darul Uloom Haqqania, a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.  .  The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but largely attended by Afghan refugees.  This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Bin Laden\\'s contacts were still laundering most of these donations, using \"unscrupulous\" Islamic banks to transfer the money to an \"array\" of charities which serve as front groups for al-Qaeda, or transporting cash-filled suitcases straight into Pakistan.  Another four of the Taliban\\'s leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.Many of the mujahideen who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi\\'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.The continuing internecine strife between various factions, and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal, enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, conquered the capital city Kabul in September 1996.After the Sudanese made it clear, in May 1996, that bin Laden would never be welcome to return,  Taliban-controlled Afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups, administered with a shared militancy,  and largely isolated from American political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al-Qaeda to relocate its headquarters. Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban\\'s protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of Brigade 055, an elite part of the Taliban\\'s army from 1997–2001. The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters, many veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as Operation Enduring Freedom had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to head into Pakistan along with bin Laden. By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,  while others cast doubt on this.  According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.  Call for global jihad  Around 1994, the Salafi groups waging jihad in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline. As they grew less and less aggressive, groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda decided to step in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist cells in Bosnia in late 1995.At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network\\'s recruiters to look for Jihadi international, Muslims who believed that jihad must be fought on a global level. The concept of a \"global Salafi jihad\" had been around since at least the early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land, at the same time, and with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy .Al-Qaeda sought to open the \"offensive phase\" of the global Salafi jihad.  Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for \"solidarity with Islamic causes around the world\", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.  Fatwas In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a fatwa (binding religious edict),  which amounted to a public declaration of war against the U.S. and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda\\'s resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes. In June 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing took place in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, attributed by some to al-Qaeda, killing 19 Americans and one Saudi local, and wounding 372. On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies where they can, when they can.  Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared: [T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, \\'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,\\' and \\'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah\\'.  Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ulema (which they saw as the paid servants of jahiliyya rulers), and took it upon themselves.   Former Russian FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was later killed, said that the FSB trained al-Zawahiri in a camp in Dagestan eight months before the 1998 fatwa.   Iraq  Al-Qaeda is Sunni, and often attacked the Iraqi Shia majority in an attempt to incite sectarian violence and greater chaos in the country.  Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites  while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings.  The same month, a statement claiming to be by AQI rejected as \"fake\" a letter allegedly written by al-Zawahiri, in which he appears to question the insurgents\\' tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shiites in Iraq.  In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians committed by \"hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks\". U.S. and Iraqi officials accused AQI of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq\\'s majority Shiites and minority Sunni Arabs, with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets. \"Al Qaeda leader in Iraq \\'killed by insurgents\\'\", ABC News, May 1, 2007  With attacks such as the 2003 Imam Ali Mosque bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 first al-Askari Mosque bombing in Samarra, the deadly single-day series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed in Baghdad\\'s Shiite district of Sadr City, and the second al-Askari bombing in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in death squad-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent anarchy in 2007. DeYoung, Karen/Pincus, Walter. \"Al-Qaeda in Iraq May Not Be Threat Here\", The Washington Post, March 18, 2007  In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda killed at least 42 people at the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala in March, and at least 51 people at a bus stop in Baghdad in June. Somalia and Yemen  In Somalia, al-Qaeda agents had been collaborating closely with its Somali wing, which was created from the al-Shabaab group. In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially joined al-Qaeda, declaring loyalty in a joint video.     The Somalian al-Qaeda actively recruit children for suicide-bomber training, and export young people to participate in military actions against Americans at the AfPak border. The percentage of terrorist attacks in the West originating from the Afghanistan-Pakistan (AfPak) border declined considerably from almost 100% to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen.  While al-Qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border, the middle-tier of the movement display heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen. “We know that South Asia is no longer their primary base,” a U.S. defense agency source said. “They are looking for a hide-out in other parts of the world, and continue to expand their organization.“In January 2009, al-Qaeda’s division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Centered in Yemen, the group takes advantage of the country\\'s poor economy, demography and domestic security. In August 2009, they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades. President Obama asked his Yemen counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh to ensure closer cooperation with the U.S. in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid. Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. was unable to pay sufficient attention to Somalia and Yemen, which could cause problems in the near future.  In December 2011, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the U.S. operations against al-Qaeda \"are now concentrating on key groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa.\"    Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.  The group released photos of Abdulmutallab smiling in a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap, with the al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background. American operations In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to the president that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the USA, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.   On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda attacked the United States, hijacking four airliners and deliberately crashing them.   The attackers killed 2,977 people.   U.S. officials called Anwar al-Awlaki an \"example of al-Qaeda reach into\" the U.S. in 2008 after probes into his ties to the September 11 attacks hijackers. A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known \"senior recruiter for al-Qaeda\", and a spiritual motivator.  Awlaki\\'s sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers, as well as accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan. U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009. On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan\\'s actions in the Fort Hood shooting. Esposito, Richard, Cole, Matthew, and Ross, Brian, \"Officials: U.S. Army Told of Hasan\\'s Contacts with al Qaeda; Army Major in Fort Hood Massacre Used \\'Electronic Means\\' to Connect with Terrorists,\" [[ABC News], November 9, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009] An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki \"has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the U.S. [after 9/11], including plotting attacks against America and our allies.” WashingtonPost.com February 27, 2008 Imam From Va. Mosque Now Thought to Have Aided Al-Qaeda.  In addition, \"Christmas Day bomber\" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab said al-Awlaki was one of his al-Qaeda trainers, meeting with him and involved in planning or preparing the attack, and provided religious justification for it, according to unnamed U.S. intelligence officials.          In March 2010, al Awlaki said in a videotape delivered to CNN that jihad against America was binding upon himself and every other able Muslim.       U.S. President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010, making al-Awlaki the first U.S. citizen ever placed on the CIA target list. That required the consent of the U.S. National Security Council, and officials said it was appropriate for an individual who posed an imminent danger to national security.             In May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators he was \"inspired by\" al-Awlaki, and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the internet.          Representative Jane Harman called him \"terrorist number one\", and Investor\\'s Business Daily called him \"the world\\'s most dangerous man\".   In July 2010, the U.S. Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda.    In August 2010, al-Awlaki\\'s father initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. government with the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki.    In October 2010, U.S. and U.K. officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot.     In September 2011, he was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen.  It was reported on March 16, 2012 that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill United States President Barack Obama.    Death of Osama bin Laden  On May 1, 2011 in Washington, D.C. (May 2, Pakistan Standard Time), U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed by \"a small team of Americans\" acting under Obama\\'s direct orders, in a covert operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan,     about   north of Islamabad.  According to U.S. officials a team of 20–25 US Navy SEALs under the command of the Joint Special Operations Command and working with the CIA stormed bin Laden\\'s compound in two helicopters. Bin Laden and those with him were killed during a firefight in which U.S. forces experienced no injuries or casualties.  According to one US official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Pakistani authorities.    In Pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by US armed forces.  The site is a few miles from the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul.  In his broadcast announcement President Obama said that U.S. forces \"took care to avoid civilian casualties.\"  Details soon emerged that three men and a woman were killed along with Bin Laden, the woman being killed when she was “used as a shield by a male combatant”.  DNA from bin Laden\\'s body, compared with DNA samples on record from his dead sister,  confirmed bin Laden\\'s identity.    The body was recovered by the US military and was in its custody    until, according to one US official, his body was buried at sea according to Islamic traditions.     One U.S. official stated that \"finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world\\'s most wanted terrorist would have been difficult.\"  U.S State Department issued a \"Worldwide caution\" for Americans following Bin Laden\\'s death and U.S Diplomatic facilities everywhere were placed on high alert, a senior U.S official said.    Crowds gathered outside the White House and in New York City\\'s Time Square to celebrate Bin Laden\\'s death.    Attacks  Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.  1992On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda\\'s first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the U.S. the attack was barely noticed.No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether, and they went on to Somalia as scheduled. However little noticed, the attack was pivotal as it was the beginning of al-Qaeda\\'s change in direction, from fighting armies to killing civilians.  .  Two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda\\'s members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.   1993 World Trade Center bombing  In 1993, Ramzi Yousef used a truck bomb to attack the World Trade Center in New York City. The attack was intended to break the foundation of Tower One knocking it into Tower Two, bringing the entire complex down.Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people. The towers shook and swayed but the foundation held and he succeeded in killing only six people (although he injured 1,042 others and caused nearly $300\\xa0million in property damage).  ;  .     After the attack, Yousef fled to Pakistan and later moved to Manila. There he began developing the Bojinka Plot plans to implode a dozen American airliners simultaneously, to assassinate Pope John Paul II and President Bill Clinton, and to crash a private plane into CIA headquarters. He was later captured in Pakistan. None of the U.S. government\\'s indictments against bin Laden have suggested that he had any connection with this bombing, but Ramzi Yousef is known to have attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. After his capture, Yousef declared that his primary justification for the attack was to punish the U.S. for its support for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and made no mention of any religious motivations.  Late 1990s   In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the U.S. Secret Service. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge. The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa, resulting in upward of 300 deaths, mostly locals. A barrage of cruise missiles launched by the U.S. military in response devastated an al-Qaeda base in Khost, Afghanistan, but the network\\'s capacity was unharmed.In October 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile destroyer U.S.S. Cole in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda\\'s command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself. September 11 attacks    The September 11,  2001 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing approximately 3,000 people. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the World Trade Center towers, a third into The Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target the United States Capitol, crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the U.S. and its allies by military forces under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.  Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander Mohamed Atta as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command.Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.  Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims. Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in \\'Palestine, Chechnya, Kashmir and Iraq\\' and that Muslims should retain the \\'right to attack in reprisal\\'. He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at women and children, but \\'America\\'s icons of military and economic power\\'. Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack \"might get out of hand\".       Designation as terrorist organizationAl-Qaeda has been designated a terrorist organization by the following countries and international organizations:   Australia    Canada    European Union    France    India  Ireland Israel    Japan    Netherlands    NATO     Philippines  Russia    South Korea    Sweden  Switzerland  Turkey    United Kingdom    United Nations Security Council    United States      War on Terrorism  In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the U.S. government decided to respond militarily, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the U.S. attacked, it offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA\\'s elite Special Activities Division (SAD).The Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the U.S. would provide evidence of bin Laden\\'s complicity in the attacks. U.S. President George W. Bush responded by saying: \"We know he\\'s guilty. Turn him over\",  and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime: \"Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power\". Soon thereafter the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government in the war in Afghanistan.As a result of the U.S. using its special forces and providing air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, both Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation. Again, under the cover of intense aerial bombardment, U.S. infantry and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda\\'s top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.Debate raged about the exact nature of al-Qaeda\\'s role in the 9/11 attacks, and after the U.S. invasion began, the U.S. State Department also released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.  Although its authenticity has been questioned by some,  the tape appears to implicate bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many television channels all over the world, with an accompanying English translation provided by the U.S. Defense Department.In September 2004, the US government 9/11 Commission investigating the September 11 attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.  In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: \"As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.\" By the end of 2004, the U.S. government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2002;    Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 2003; and Saif al Islam el Masry in 2004.  Mohammed Atef and several others were killed.   Activities Africa  Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, as well as supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.         French officials say the rebels have no real links to the al-Qaeda leadership, but this is a matter of some dispute in the international press and amongst security analysts. It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group\\'s name in late 2006, and the rebels \"took on the al Qaeda franchise label\", almost a year before the violence began to escalate.  In Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of Al-Qaeda in 2013.  The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.  Europe  In 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in Istanbul killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met Bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.  In 2009, three Londoners, Tanvir Hussain, Assad Sarwar and Ahmed Abdullah Ali, were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for Canada and the U.S. The massively complex police and MI5 investigation of the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers.        British and U.S. officials said the plan—unlike many recent homegrown European terrorist plots—was directly linked to al-Qaeda and guided by senior Islamic militants in Pakistan.   In 2012, Russian Intelligence indicated that al-Qaeda had given a call for \"forest jihad\" and has been starting massive forest fires as part of a strategy of \"thousand cuts\".  Arab world  Following Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country in an effort to subvert the capitalist north. Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing.  Concerns grow over Al Qaeda\\'s group in Yemen. In Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the Jama\\'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad organization commanded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a \"key driver\" of the Sunni insurgency.  Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi\\'s organization. See the following works cited in  :      Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa\\'qaa munitions factory in Yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida.  In November 2010, the Islamic State of Iraq militant group, which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to \"exterminate Iraqi Christians\".   Significantly, it was not until the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began training Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan.  .  Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects—have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, as Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.  Kashmir Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of the ‘Crusader-Zionist-Hindu’ conspiracy against the Islamic world.  According to the 2005 report \\'Al Qaeda: Profile and Threat Assessment\\' by Congressional Research Service, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early nineties. By 2001 Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (in Azad Kashmir, and to some extent in Gilgit–Baltistan) during the 1999 Kargil War and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan\\'s Intelligence services. Many of the militants active in Kashmir were trained in the same Madrasahs as Taliban and al-Qaeda. Fazlur Rehman Khalil of Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was a signatory of al-Qaeda\\'s 1998 declaration of Jihad against America and its allies. Kashmir Militant Extremists, Council on Foreign Relations, July 9, 2009  In a \\'Letter to American People\\' written by bin Laden in 2002 he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of her support to India on the Kashmir issue.   In November 2001 Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that Bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi.  In 2002 U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on a trip to Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence.  Rumsfeld offers US technology to guard Kashmir border, The Sydney Morning Herald, June 14, 2002  He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.  An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan\\'s National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence  In 2002 a special team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian Administered Kashmir to hunt for Bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen which had previously been responsible for 1995 Kidnapping of western tourists in Kashmir.  Britain\\'s highest ranking al-Qaeda operative Rangzieb Ahmed had previously fought in Kashmir with the group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and spent time in Indian prison after being captured in Kashmir. U.S. officials believe that al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.  Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan.  In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this has worried the Indian government.   However the Indian Army Lt. Gen. H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, said to reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir; furthermore he said that there is nothing that can verify reports from the media of al-Qaeda presence in the state. He however stated that al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan.  It has been noted that Waziristan has now become the new battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban.    Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah In Kashmir  and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir. Maulana Masood Azhar, the founder of another Kashmiri group Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have met bin Laden several times and received funding from him.  In 2002 Jaish-e-Mohammed organized the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl in an operation run in conjunction with al-Qaeda and funded by Bin Laden.  According to American counter-terrorism expert Bruce Riedel, al-Qaeda and Taliban were closely involved in the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 to Kandahar which led to the release of Maulana Masood Azhar & Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh from an Indian prison in exchange for the passengers. This hijacking, Riedel stated, was rightly described by then Indian Foreign minister Jaswant Singh as a \\'dress rehearsal\\' for September 11 attacks.  Bin laden personally welcomed Azhar and threw a lavish party in his honor after his release, according to Abu Jandal, bodyguard of Bin Laden.   Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been in Indian prison for his role in 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India, went on to murder Daniel Pearl and was sentenced to death by Pakistan. Al-Qaeda operative Rashid Rauf, who was one of the accused in 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, was related to Maulana Masood Azhar by marriage. Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan.  In Late 2002 top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad. Lashkar-e-Taiba Served as Gateway for Western Converts Turning to Jihad, The Wall Street Journal, December 4, 2008  The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been \\'intertwined\\' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba.  French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière, who was the top French counter-terrorism official, told Reuters in 2009 that \\'Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda.\\'  In a video released in 2008, senior al-Qaeda operative American-born Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that \"victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land.\" In September 2009 a U.S. Drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda.  Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a \\'prominent\\' al-Qaeda member  while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda.   Kashmiri was also charged by the U.S. in a plot against Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.  U.S. officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA.  In January 2010 Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city. This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja, an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, who had been arrested in India. In January 2010 U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates, while on a visit to Pakistan, stated that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.  InternetTimothy L. Thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. As a result, the organization\\'s use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering and sharing.  Abu Ayyub al-Masri’s al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the Mujahideen Shura Council, has a regular presence on the Web. The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur Nick Berg being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of Paul Johnson, Kim Sun-il, and Daniel Pearl, were first posted on jihadist websites.In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from Bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past.Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the Saudi royal family.  Bin Laden\\'s December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.In the past, Alneda.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.The U.S. is currently attempting to extradite a British information technology specialist, Babar Ahmad, on charges of operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com.   Ahmad\\'s extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such as the Muslim Association of Britain. Aviation networkAl-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including “several Boeing 727 aircraft”, turboprops and executive jets, according to a Reuters story. Based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping some Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.  Alleged CIA involvement  Experts debate whether or not the al-Qaeda attacks were blowback from the American CIA\\'s \"Operation Cyclone\" program to help the Afghan mujahideen. Robin Cook, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and Bin Laden were \"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\", and that \"Al-Qaida, literally \\'the database\\', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians.\"  Munir Akram, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in the New York Times on January 19, 2008:  The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.  A variety of sources—CNN journalist Peter Bergen, Pakistani ISI Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as Vincent Cannistraro—deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or Bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight;  that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.According to Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that \"the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ...[is] a folk myth. There\\'s no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn\\'t really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\"  But Bergen conceded that, in one \"strange incident,\" the CIA appeared to give visa help to mujahideen-recruiter Omar Abdel-Rahman. In his widely praised account of al-Qaeda, English journalist Jason Burke wrote:  Broader influenceAnders Breivik was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of al-Qaida.\"   CriticismAccording to a number of sources there has been a \"wave of revulsion\" against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" alarmed by al-Qaeda\\'s takfir and killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially Iraq. Noman Benotman, a former Afghan Arab and militant of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007 after persuading imprisoned senior leadership of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months later after \"they were said to have renounced violence.\" In 2007, around the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and a couple of months before Rationalizing Jihad first appeared in the newspapers,  the Saudi sheikh Salman al-Ouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.  Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda\\'s leader on television asking him  My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed ... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?  .  According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda has been slightly dropped for parts of the Muslim world in the years before 2008.  The numbers supporting suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, for instance, have dropped by half or more in the last five years. In Saudi Arabia, only 10\\xa0percent now have a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based think tank. In 2007, the imprisoned Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif, an influential Afghan Arab, \"ideological godfather of al-Qaeda\", and former supporter of takfir, sensationally withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book Wathiqat Tarshid Al-\\'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w\\'Al-\\'Alam (Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World).Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 LIFG completed a new \"code\" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled \"Corrective Studies\". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG\\'s about face may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda\\'s recruitment.

It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 29 July 1985, and landed just under eight days later on 6 August.While STS-51-F\\'s primary payload was the Spacelab 2 laboratory module, the payload which received the most publicity was the Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both Coca-Cola and Pepsi tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.  Crew  Backup crew  Mission parameters Mass: Orbiter Liftoff:    Orbiter Landing:    Payload:    Perigee:   Apogee:   Inclination: 49.5° Period: 90.9 min LaunchSTS-51-F\\'s first launch attempt on 12 July 1985 was halted with the countdown at T-3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction of the number two Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main engines. Challenger launched successfully on its second attempt at 29 July 1985, 17:00 EDT, after a delay of one hour and 37 minutes due to a problem with the table maintenance block update uplink. Three minutes and 31 seconds into the ascent, one of the center engine\\'s two high pressure fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. Two minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the center engine. This was the only in-flight main engine failure of the shuttle program. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. Booster Systems Engineer Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic SSME shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible abort mode that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.   The failed SSME resulted in an Abort to Orbit (ATO) trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieved a lower-than-planned orbital altitude. Mission summary STS-51-F\\'s primary payload was the laboratory module Spacelab 2. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the \"igloo\", which was located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered life sciences, plasma physics, astronomy, high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, atmospheric physics and technology research. Despite mission replanning necessitated by Challenger \\' s abort to orbit trajectory, the Spacelab mission was declared a success.The flight marked the first time the ESA Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one arcsecond. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the Sun, but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected. In addition, Tony England became the second amateur radio operator to transmit from space during the mission.The Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) was also flown on the mission.  The IRT was a 15.2\\xa0cm aperture helium-cooled infrared telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm. Kent, et al. – Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope (1992).  The experiment experienced some problems, such as heat emissions from the Shuttle corrupting data, but still returned useful astronomical data. In a heavily-publicised marketing experiment, astronauts aboard STS-51-F enjoyed carbonated beverages from specially-designed cans provided by competitors Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  Post-flight, the astronauts revealed that they preferred the traditional astronaut\\'s drink Tang, in part because it could be mixed on-orbit with existing chilled water supplies, whereas there was no dedicated refrigeration equipment on board to chill the soda, which also fizzed excessively in microgravity. LandingChallenger landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on 6 August 1985, at 12:45:26\\xa0pm PDT. Its rollout distance was  . The mission had been extended by 17 orbits for additional payload activities due to the Abort to Orbit. The orbiter arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on 11 August 1985. Mission insigniaThe mission insignia was designed by Houston artist Skip Bradley.

It was also known as the House of Anhalt, after Anhalt, its longest-held possession.The Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, Schloss Askanien, which is located near and named after Aschersleben. The castle was seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt. History The earliest known member of the house, Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt, first appears in a document of 1036, and is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the Saxon Eastern March.Esiko\\'s grandson was Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, who died in 1123.  By Otto\\'s marriage to Eilika, daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony, the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of Billung, former dukes of Saxony. Otto\\'s son, Albert the Bear, became, with the help of his mother\\'s inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. But he lost control of Saxony soon to the rival House of Guelph.However, Albert inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg from its last Wendish ruler, Pribislav, in 1157, and became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in Christianizing and Germanizing the lands. As a borderland between German and Slavic cultures, the country was known as a march. In 1237 and 1244 two towns, Cölln and Berlin were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear, (later they were united into one city, Berlin). The emblem of the House of Ascania, red eagle and bear, became the heraldic emblems of Berlin.In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.After the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe. In the 13th century, the Principality of Anhalt was split off from the Duchy, and later, the remaining state was split into Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until monarchy was abolished in 1918. Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.

An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.       For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, … 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i. Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are more correctly the mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement tables, especially lookup tables; the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array.Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings.  They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.  Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time.  Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array.  For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,  T. Veldhuizen. Arrays in Blitz++. In Proc. of the 2nd Int. Conf. on Scientific Computing in Object-Oriented Parallel Environments (ISCOPE), LNCS 1505, pages 223-220. Springer, 1998.  but not always,  fixed while the array is in use.The term array is often used to mean array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time.  Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or \"abstract array\", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays. HistoryThe first digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and access array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and for many other purposes. Von Neumann wrote the first array-sorting program (merge sort) in 1945, during the building of the first stored-program computer.  p.\\xa0159   Array indexing was originally done by self-modifying code, and later using index registers and indirect addressing.  Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the Burroughs B5000 and its successors, had special instructions for array indexing that included index-bounds checking. .Assembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1960), and ALGOL 60 (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has C (1972). In C++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime   as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.   ApplicationsArrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.  Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists.One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate \"dynamic memory\" portably.Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive), multiple  IF  statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain subroutine pointers (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by SWITCH statements) - that direct the path of the execution. Array element identifier and addressing formulas When data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. Indices are also called subscripts.  An index maps the array value to a stored object.There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed: 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.  1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1.  n (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index. Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example a two-dimensional array   A  with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression:  A[1, 3]  (in a row major language) and  A[3, 1]  (in a column major language) in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array.The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array.In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a \"linear\" formula on the indices. One-dimensional arraysA one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.As an example consider the C declaration  int anArrayName[10]; Syntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray];In the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the  int  type.  In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case.  For example, the expressions  anArrayName[0] , and  anArrayName[9]  are the first and last elements respectively.For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the  address increment or stride.If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element \"zeroth\" rather than \"first\".However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address B.  For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35.  If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant B may not be the address of any element. Multidimensional arraysFor a two-dimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address B + c · i + d · j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively.More generally, in a k-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices i 1 , i 2 , …, i k  is B + c 1  · i 1  + c 2  · i 2  + … + c k  · i k . For example: int a[3][2];This means that array a has 3 rows and 2 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they are stored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a 11 , a 12 , a 13 , a 21 , a 22 , a 23 .This formula requires only k multiplications and k−1 additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by bit shifting.The coefficients c k  must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.If the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then B is the address of the element whose indices are all zero.  As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address B.  Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing  B by B + c 1  - − 3 c 1  will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively.  Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition; while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index. Dope vectorsThe addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension d, the base address B, and the increments c 1 , c 2 , …, c k .  It is often  useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array\\'s descriptor or stride vector or dope vector.    The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector.  The dope vector is a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures.  Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.  Compact layoutsOften the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory.  However, that is not necessary.  Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.There are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array.  For example, consider the matrix  \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\end{bmatrix}.   In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a columns have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column: 1  4  7  2  5  8  3  6  9 For arrays with three or more indices, \"row major order\" puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the last index.  \"Column major order\" is analogous with respect to the first index.In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered.  Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array.  For example,  when computing the product A·B of two matrices, it would be best to have A stored in row-major order, and  B in column-major order. Array resizing Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a dynamic version of an array; see dynamic array. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; Pascal strings are examples of this. Non-linear formulasMore complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2. EfficiencyBoth store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold.In an array with element size k and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of n elements requires the minimum of ceiling(nk/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/k better than the number of cache misses needed to access n elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element overhead. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require less memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single word; such arrays are often called packed arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism. Efficiency comparison with other data structures  Growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.Associative arrays provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include Patricia tries, Judy arrays, and van Emde Boas trees.Balanced trees require O(log n) time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log n) time,  whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(n)) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.Linked lists allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear. An Iliffe vector is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of references to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row.  Thus an element in row i and column j of an array A would be accessed by double indexing (A[i][j] in typical notation).  This alternative structure allows ragged or jagged arrays, where each row may have a different size — or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices.  It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.  Meaning of dimensionThe dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.This should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.

Bishkek is also the administrative centre of Chuy Province which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.The name is thought to derive from a Kyrgyz word for a churn used to make fermented mare\\'s milk (kumis), the Kyrgyz national drink. Founded in 1825 as the Kyrgyz-Khokand fortress of \"Bishkek\", then, in 1862, named as the Russian fortress Pishpek (крепость Пишпек),  in 1926 the city was renamed Frunze (Фрунзе), after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament restored the city\\'s historical name.Bishkek is situated at about   altitude just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range, which rises up to   and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan-Siberia Railway by a spur line.Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers. HistoryOriginally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the Sogdians) on one of the branches of the Silk Road through the Tian Shan range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the Uzbek khan of Kokhand with a mud fort.In 1862, the fort was conquered and razed when Tsarist Russia annexed the area. The Russians rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort. The site became a Russian garrison and was redeveloped and named \"Pishpek\" from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile black soil farms to develop. In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established Kirghiz ASSR and was renamed \"Frunze\" after Mikhail Frunze, Lenin\\'s close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the 1905 and 1917 revolutions and during the Russian civil war of the early 1920s.The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Before independence, Bishkek was a \"Russified\" city, the majority of its population being ethnic Russians. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city\\'s population (only about 7–8% in 2011).   Today, Bishkek is a modernizing city, with many restaurants and cafes and lots of second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. But streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the Russians started rapidly leaving in the 90s. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.Bishkek is also the country\\'s financial centre, with all of the country\\'s 21 commercial banks featuring offices in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down after 1991 or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of  Bishkek\\'s largest employment centres today is Dordoy Bazaar, which is one of the major entrepôts for Chinese goods imported into CIS countries. Geography OrientationThough the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the Greco-Buddhist period, the period of Nestorian influence, the era of the Central Asian khanates, and the Soviet period. The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city\\'s main street is the east-west Chui Avenue (Chuy Prospekti), named after the region\\'s main river. In the Soviet era, it was called Lenin Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the Academy of Sciences compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as Deng Xiaoping Avenue.The main north-south axis is Yusup Abdrakhmanov Street, still (2007) commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to Dordoy Bazaar.Erkindik (\"Freedom\") Boulevard runs north-south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after Communist revolutionary, Felix Dzerzhinsky—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.An important east-west street is Jibek Jolu (\\'Silk Road\\'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east-west road of Chui Province. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.  City centre State Historical Museum, located in Ala-Too Square, the main city square State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional handicrafts Frunze House Museum Statue of Ivan Panfilov stands in the park near the White House. An equestrian statue of Mikhail Frunze still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station. The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station. The main government building, the White House, is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched. Osh bazaar, west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market Outer neighbourhoodsThe Dordoy Bazaar, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market. Outside the cityThe Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range, some   away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the Ala Archa National Park is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away. ClimateGrodnye has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa)  averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average precipitation is around   per year. Average daily temperatures range from   in January to about   during July.  The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional thunderstorm which produces strong gusty winds and rare dust storms. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse snow storms and frequent heavy fog are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.     DemographicsBishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, according to the Population and Housing Census of 2009, was 835,800.  Ecology and environment Air qualityEmissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.    Of all other cities of Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest with occasional exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city\\'s center.  For example, occasionally formaldehyde concentrations exceed maximum allowable ones by four times.  Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.  Economy  Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the som. The som\\'s value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits, vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures. GovernmentLocal government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor\\'s Office. Askarbek Salymbekov was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy Arstanbek Nogoev took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov.    In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways Nariman Tuleyev was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. Now interim mayor is Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways.  SportsBishkek is home to Spartak, the biggest football stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches.  Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, Dordoi-Dynamo.The city is home to the Bandy Federation of Kyrgyzstan  which is a member of the IOC recognized  Federation of International Bandy. Alex Kantrowitz (Russian man), originally from Bishkek, is a noted Olympic swimmer for the Czech Republic.

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system (Бишкекское лёгкое метро). Commuter and long-distance busesThere are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as Kant, Kyrgyzstan, Tokmok, Kemin, Issyk Ata, or the Korday border crossing.Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to Almaty (the largest city in neighboring Kazakhstan) and Kashgar, China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from Sokuluk in the west to Tokmak in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia. RailAs of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia (Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk), via Almaty, over the Turksib route, and to Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via Astana. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a   before they enter the main Turksib line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the Shu junction—a distance of some   by rail, and less than half of that by road.  AirThe city is served by Manas International Airport (IATA code FRU), located approximately   northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an air base for its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own (Kant Air Base) near Kant some   east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, Hosni Mubarak, later became president of Egypt.

Every two years the meeting is held in a different member state, and is chaired by that nation\\'s respective Prime Minister or President, who becomes the Commonwealth Chairperson-in-Office.  Recently, meetings have been attended by Queen Elizabeth II, who is the Head of the Commonwealth, although the Queen\\'s formal appearance only began in 1997. The first CHOGM was held in 1971, and there have been twenty-one held in total: the most recent was held in Perth, Western Australia. They are held once every two years, although this pattern has twice been interrupted.  They are held around the Commonwealth, rotating by invitation amongst its members.In the past, CHOGMs have attempted to orchestrate common policies on certain contentious issues and current events, with a special focus on issues affecting member nations.  CHOGMs have discussed the continuation of apartheid rule in South Africa and how to end it, military coups in Pakistan and Fiji, and allegations of electoral fraud in Zimbabwe.  Sometimes the member states agree on a common idea or solution, and release a joint statement declaring their opinion.  More recently, beginning at the 1997 CHOGM, the meeting has had an official \\'theme\\', set by the host nation, on which the primary discussions have been focused.    History The meetings originated with the leaders of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire.     The First Colonial Conference in 1887 was followed by periodic meetings, known as Imperial Conferences from 1911, of government leaders of the Empire.  The development of the independence of the dominions, and the creation of a number of new dominions, as well as the invitation of Southern Rhodesia (which also attended as a sui generis colony),  changed the nature of the meetings.   As the dominion leaders asserted themselves more and more at the meetings, it became clear that the time for \\'imperial\\' conferences was over.From the ashes of the Second World War, seventeen Commonwealth Prime Ministers\\' Conferences were held between 1944 and 1969.  Of these, sixteen were held in London, reflecting then-prevailing views of the Commonwealth as the continuation of the Empire and the centralisation of power in the British Commonwealth Office (the one meeting outside London, in Lagos, was an extraordinary meeting held in January 1966 to coordinate policies towards Rhodesia).  Two supplementary meetings were also held during this period: a Commonwealth Statesmen\\'s meeting to discuss peace terms in April 1945, and a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.The 1960s saw an overhaul of the Commonwealth.  The swift expansion of the Commonwealth after decolonisation saw the newly-independent countries demand the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the United Kingdom, in response, successfully founding the Commonwealth Foundation.     This decentralisation of power demanded a reformulation of the meetings.  Instead of the meetings always being held in London, they would rotate across the membership, subject to countries\\' ability to host the meetings: beginning with Singapore in 1971.  They were also renamed the \\'Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings\\' to reflect the growing diversity of the constitutional structures in the Commonwealth. Structure The core of the CHOGM are the executive sessions, which are the formal gatherings of the heads of government to do business.  However, the majority of the important decisions are held not in the main meetings themselves, but at the informal \\'retreats\\': introduced at the second CHOGM, in Ottawa, by Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau,  but reminiscent of the excursions to Chequers or Dorneywood in the days of the Prime Ministers\\' Conferences.   The rules are very strict: allowing the head of the delegation, his or her spouse, and one other person.  The additional member can be of any capacity (personal, political, security, etc.), but he or she has only occasional and intermittent access to the head.   It is usually at the retreat where, isolated from their advisers, the heads resolve the most intransigent issues: leading to the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, the Lusaka Declaration in 1979, the Langkawi Declaration in 1989, the Millbrook Programme in 1995, and the Aso Rock Declaration in 2003. The \\'fringe\\' of civil society organisations, including the Commonwealth Family and local groups, adds a cultural dimension to the event, and brings the CHOGM a higher media profile and greater acceptance by the local population.   First officially recognised at Limassol in 1993,  these events, spanning a longer period than the meeting itself, have, to an extent, preserved the length of the CHOGM: but only in the cultural sphere.   Other meetings, such as those of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, Commonwealth Business Council, and respective foreign ministers, have also dealt with business away from the heads of government themselves.As the scope of the CHOGM has expanded beyond the meetings of the heads of governments themselves, the CHOGMs have become progressively shorter, and their business more compacted into less time.     The 1971 CHOGM lasted for nine days, and the 1977 and 1991 CHOGMs for seven days each.  However, Harare\\'s epochal CHOGM was the last to last a week; the 1993 CHOGM lasted for five days, and the contentious 1995 CHOGM for only three-and-a-half, setting a precedent that has lasted since.  IssuesDuring the 1980s, CHOGMs were dominated by calls for the Commonwealth to impose sanctions on South Africa to pressure the country to end apartheid. The division between the United Kingdom during the government of Margaret Thatcher which resisted the call for sanctions and African Commonwealth countries was intense at times and led to speculation that the organization might collapse.In 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron informed the British House of Commons that his proposals to reform the rules governing royal succession, a change which would require the approval of all Commonwealth realms, was approved at the  28–30 October CHOGM in Perth.  AgendaUnder the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, each CHOGM is responsible for renewing the remit of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, whose responsibility it is to uphold the Harare Declaration on the core political principles of the Commonwealth.  IncidentsAs the convocation of heads of governments and permanent Commonwealth staff and experts, CHOGMs are the highest institution of action in the Commonwealth, and rare occasions on which Commonwealth leaders all come together.  CHOGMs have been the venues of many of the Commonwealth\\'s most dramatic events.  Robert Mugabe announced Zimbabwe\\'s immediate withdrawal from the Commonwealth at the 2003 CHOGM,  and Nigeria\\'s execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others on the first day of the 1995 CHOGM led to that country\\'s suspension. It has also been the trigger of a number of events that have shook participating countries domestically.  The departure of Uganda\\'s President Milton Obote to the 1971 CHOGM allowed Idi Amin to overthrow Obote\\'s government.  Similarly, President James Mancham\\'s attendance of the 1977 CHOGM gave Prime Minister France-Albert René the opportunity to seize power in the Seychelles.

He is best known for playing Dave Lister in the British science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lloyd Mullaney in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street.Charles first appeared on television as a performance poet, which led on to minor presenting roles. After finding fame in Red Dwarf, he regularly featured on national television, with celebrity appearances on many popular shows, while he continued to host a wide variety of programmes. He has toured the UK extensively as a stand-up comedian.Charles notably presented the gladiator-style game show Robot Wars and narrated the comedy endurance show Takeshi\\'s Castle. His acting credits include playing inmate Eugene Buffy in the ITV drama The Governor, and leading roles in the British films Fated and Clubbing to Death. As well as starring in Coronation Street and occasional Red Dwarf series, Charles continues to host The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show on BBC radio, and performs DJ sets at numerous clubs and festivals nationally and internationally. Early lifeCharles was born to a mixed race family in Liverpool: his Guyanese father was black,  and his mother was white Irish.  Charles has an older brother, Dean, and a younger brother, Emile. He grew up on the deprived Cantril Farm housing estate,  and went to school with Micky Quinn,  who became a professional footballer. He attended West Derby Comprehensive School followed by Childwall Hall College of Further Education, and studied A-levels in History, Government and Politics, English Literature and General Studies.  Charles won a national competition, run by The Guardian newspaper, for a poem he wrote when he was 12-years-old.  Early careerCharles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British cabaret circuit. His performances were considered original, with Charles described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to talent scouts. In 1981, Charles climbed on stage at a Teardrop Explodes concert and recited a humorous, but derogatory, poem about the band\\'s singer. He was invited to open subsequent gigs for the group, and went on to perform as a support act in pubs and clubs, for the next three years,  and at events such as the Larks in the Park music festival at Sefton Park (1982). He performed poetry at Liverpool\\'s Everyman Theatre (1983), alongside such poets as Roger McGough and Adrian Henri.Charles was involved in the Liverpool music scene, writing and singing lyrics for a number of local rock bands.  In 1980, he played keyboards and provided voice in the rock band Watt 4.  He performed his political rap lyrics as a \\'Wordsmith\\'. In 1983, Charles was invited to record a session on the John Peel BBC Radio show, performing six poems with a band. This was his first professional engagement.  He recorded further tracks that year which were used as a ‘demo’ to secure a further Peel Session in 1984, where he performed three songs. Charles realised he was using poetry as a vehicle for his sense of humour, and progressed into stand-up comedy. He was part of the Red Wedge comedy tour in 1986, which aimed to raise awareness of the social problems of the time, in support of the Labour Party. He performed his first one-man show in 1986,  which premiered in Edinburgh, and then toured internationally.  Charles was a guest on programmes including Janice Long\\'s Radio 1 show,  and was a regular panellist on Ned Sherrin\\'s chat show Loose Ends (1987-8) on BBC Radio 4.  Television career Performance PoetryCharles first appeared on television as the resident poet on the arts programme Riverside on BBC2, and on the day-time BBC1 chat show Pebble Mill at One.  Charles was the resident poet on Channel 4\\'s Black on Black (1985),  and its entertainment-based successor, Club Mix (1986), and he appeared, weekly, as a John Cooper Clarke-style \\'punk poet\\' on the BBC2 pop music programme Oxford Road Show (ORS). He performed his political poems as stand-up comedy on the late-night show, Saturday Live, and on the prime-time BBC1 chat show Wogan, where he performed a topical poem in a weekly feature. He also appeared as a guest on shows including Open Air (1988). Charles included significant acting in his performance style, to enable him to put the emotion across.  Red DwarfCharles acquired cult status in 1988, in his first television acting role, as the Liverpudlian slob Dave Lister, in BBC2\\'s new science fiction comedy series Red Dwarf. Charles has played this role in all eight series, until 1999, and in the 2009 three-part special, Red Dwarf: Back to Earth and Red Dwarf X (2012), for channel Dave.  Charles\\' younger brother, Emile Charles, guest-starred in the series III episode \"Timeslides\", and the songs \"Bad News\" and \"Cash\" in this episode were written by Charles, and performed by his band.  The role has involved Charles playing a variety of alternative characters, including a gangster, a cowboy, and angelic and evil versions of Lister,  and in him carrying out a wide range of stunts, and acting involving special effects. All episodes, except those of series VII and IX, were recorded in front of a studio audience.Charles reads the audiobook editions of the Red Dwarf novel Last Human, and his book The Log: A Dwarfer\\'s Guide to Everything, and he regularly attends sci-fi, comedy and memorabilia conventions in connection with the Red Dwarf franchise. During Back to Earth, Charles\\' character, Lister, visits the set of Coronation Street where he meets the actor Craig Charles. Charles has stated that he would be happy to make further Red Dwarf episodes if his Coronation Street commitments allow.  Robot WarsCharles notably presented the cult TV hit Robot Wars on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–2004), from series 2 until its conclusion at series 7, which included two Extreme series and numerous \\'specials\\'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short Robot Wars-themed poem. Charles\\' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on \"Team Nemesis\" during series 4. Charles also hosted the Robot Wars Live UK tour, in 2001, and shows performed at the Wembley Arena. Takeshi\\'s CastleCharles provided the voice-over commentary for the UK version of the Japanese game show Takeshi\\'s Castle, shown on Challenge and Ftn (2002–2004), in which contestants attempted to pass a series of near-impossible physical challenges, to reach the final showdown at the castle and win cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the scripted sections and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and the special episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants\\' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers. Coronation StreetIn 2005, Charles joined the principal cast of Coronation Street, the world\\'s longest-running TV soap opera, playing philandering taxicab driver, Lloyd Mullaney.  Charles introduced certain aspects of the character himself, making Lloyd a Northern Soul music record collector and funk music enthusiast. Lloyd is portrayed as tough, but kind hearted and romantic, and the character is popular with viewers. Charles adds a comedy element to the role, but is also involved in traumatic and emotional scenes with complicated storylines. In 2010, his character was involved in the show\\'s dramatic 50th anniversary tram crash storyline, which was recorded live. Charles has presented documentaries for the show, including 50 Years of Corrie Stunts (2010), which is included on the Tram Crash DVD. In November 2011, Charles took time off from Coronation Street to film a new series of Red Dwarf, returning in April 2012.

WritingIn 1993, Charles worked with Russell Bell on the Craig Charles Almanac of Total Knowledge writing about his \\'streetwise\\' sense of humour on a range of topics, from the world\\'s most embarrassing stories to how to explain the mysteries of the universe. In 1997, he and Russell wrote Charles\\' Red Dwarf character\\'s book The Log, in which Lister decides to leave a log detailing mankind\\'s greatest achievements. In 1998, Charles published No Other Blue, a collection of his poetry, with illustrations by Philippa Drakeford, on diverse personal subjects including prison, his mother\\'s final illness, love, and politics at home and abroad.In 2000, Charles wrote his first autobiography about his experiences growing up in Liverpool, titled No Irish, No Niggers. In 2007, he announced he would release his autobiography, planned for March 2008, published by Hodder Headline and titled On the Rocks, which would cover the recent incidents in his life. The autobiography would be based on much of his journal, which he said he kept while in rehab. Charles has been involved in journalism and has had a column in Time Out magazine.

Rape allegationIn July 1994, Charles and a friend were arrested and remanded in custody for several months on a rape charge.  While in prison, Charles was attacked by a man wielding a knife.  In March 1995, both men were acquitted in their trial. After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that \"the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called \\'victim\\' has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed.\"  Drug useIn June 2006, newspaper allegations of crack cocaine use resulted in Charles being suspended from both Coronation Street  and BBC Radio 6 Music. In August, Charles was arrested and released on bail pending further enquiries and, in September, he accepted a caution for possession of a Class A drug.  Charles returned to hosting his 6 Music show from November 2006 and to filming Coronation Street from January 2007.

Cardinals are collectively known as the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the pope if he requests their counsel. Most cardinals have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or running a department of the Roman Curia.A cardinal\\'s other main function is electing the pope whenever, by death or resignation or in any other case when the seat becomes vacant. In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. During the sede vacante, the period between a pope\\'s death or resignation and the election of his successor, the day-to-day governance of the Church as a whole is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the conclave of cardinals who elect the pope is now limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years on the day of the pope\\'s death or resignation.The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church,    or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin cardo (hinge), meaning \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli (parishes) of the diocese of Rome.  A remnant of these earlier cardinals is retained by the Church of England, where the title of \"cardinal\"  is still held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul\\'s Cathedral.In the twelfth century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them being assigned a church in Rome as his titular church, or being linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.  History    The election of the pope was not always reserved to the cardinals; the pope was originally elected by the clergy and the people of the diocese of Rome. In medieval times, Roman nobility gained influence. The Holy Roman Emperors had a hand in choosing the pontiff. As the pope gained greater political independence, however, the right of election was, as stated in the bull In nomine Domini, reserved to cardinals in 1059, leaving the emperor only with a vague right of approbation. The influence of temporal rulers, however, notably the French kings, largely reemerged via cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements.  Traditions have even developed entitling certain monarchs (e.g., of Austria, Spain, and Portugal) to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called crown-cardinal. In theory, the pope could substitute another body of electors for the College of Cardinals. Some proposed that the Synod of Bishops should perform this function, a proposal that was not accepted, because, among other reasons, the Synod of Bishops can only meet when called by the pope. In early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. An example of this was found in Henry VIII\\'s England where his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey. An even more prominent example is that of Cardinal Richelieu, whose power was so great that he was for many years the real ruler of France.  Richelieu was so successful that his successor, Jules Mazarin, was also a cardinal. Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the \"four great\" cardinals to have ruled France.  In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned, thus becoming the only cardinal-king in the world.As of 2012, the youngest cardinal was Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal (born 1959, elevated 2012), the Major Archbishop of Trivandrum of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The oldest living cardinal, following the death of Cardinal Mayer in 2010, was Ersilio Tonini, the Archbishop Emeritus of Ravenna-Cervia (born 1914, elevated 1994).  College and orders of cardinalatePope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70, composed of six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons; however, Pope John XXIII began to exceed the overall limit of 70, and this continued under his successors. At the start of 1971, Pope Paul VI set an age limit of eighty years for electors, who were to number no more than 120, but set no limit to the number of cardinals as a whole, including those over eighty. (As a result of the setting of the age limit at the start of 1971, twenty-five living cardinals, including the last three surviving cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI, lost the right to participate in a conclave.) Since Popes can dispense from church laws,  they have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, perhaps calculating that the number would be sufficiently reduced by the time the need for a conclave would arise.     And in fact, since the 120 limit was enacted, no conclave has been held with even a full 120 entitled to participate. Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who are made cardinals. Titular church Each cardinal takes on a titular church, either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees. The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. The Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular Church retain that church.  Title and reference styleSince 1630, cardinals have taken the style Eminence. In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated Card.) after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen\". Similarly, the official signature of popes inserts the Latin title Papa (abbreviated Pp. ) immediately after the personal name, as \"Franciscus Pp. for Pope Francis. Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan,  hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them, even in English; and this is the usual but not the only way of referring to cardinals in Latin.  Several influential stylebooks, both secular  and religious,  however, indicate that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is as \"Cardinal    \". This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. A well-known instance of the \"John Cardinal Doe\" style is that in the proclamation, in Latin, of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon: \"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam: Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum (first name) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem (last name), ...\"  (Meaning: \"I announce to you a great joy; we have a Pope: The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord, Lord (first name) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church (last name), ...\") Orders Cardinal Bishop  Cardinal Bishops (Cardinals of the Episcopal Order) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church. Though in modern times most Cardinals are also Bishops, the term \"Cardinal Bishop\" only refers to the Cardinals that are titular Bishops of one of the \"suburbicarian\" sees.In early times, the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the Cardinals, and for centuries the Pope was customarily a Roman priest and never a Bishop from elsewhere; to preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating the Pope as a Bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a Bishop. The rule remains that, if the person elected Pope is not yet a Bishop, he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia.The Dean of the College of Cardinals, the primus inter pares of the College of Cardinals, is elected by the Cardinal Bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the Pope. Formerly the position of Dean belonged to the longest-serving of the Cardinal Bishops, all six of whom then headed a suburbicarian see. Though these sees are now seven (Ostia and Velletri having been separated in 1914), there are only six Cardinal Bishops, since the Dean always adds the title of Ostia to his original suburbicarian diocese. With the increasing involvement of the Cardinal Bishops in the curia, their dioceses (except Ostia, which is administered by the Holy See) are administered by diocesan Bishops.Currently the Cardinal Bishops of the suburbicarian diocese are: Angelo Sodano, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Albano, Dean of the College of Cardinals, former Cardinal Secretary of State Roger Etchegaray, Cardinal Bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina, Vice-Dean, President emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace Giovanni Battista Re, Cardinal Bishop of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Bishops Francis Arinze, Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Tarcisio Bertone, Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church José Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Bishop of Palestrina, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving Cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the Cardinal Bishops, just as Cardinal Deacons of ten years\\' standing are still entitled to become Cardinal Priests. Since then, Cardinals have been advanced to Cardinal Bishop exclusively by papal appointment.In 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his motu proprio Ad Purpuratorum Patrum that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named Cardinals would also be part of the episcopal order, ranked after the six Cardinal Bishops of the suburbicarian sees (who had been relieved of direct responsibilities for those sees by Pope John XXIII three years earlier). Not holding a suburbicarian see, they cannot elect the Dean nor become Dean. There are currently four Eastern Patriarchs who are Cardinal Bishops: Nasrallah Sfeir, Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch of the Maronites Emmanuel III Delly, Patriarch Emeritus of Babylon of the Chaldeans Antonios Naguib, Patriarch Emeritus of Alexandria of the Copts Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites The Latin Rite Patriarchs of Lisbon and Venice, while in practice always made Cardinals at the consistory after they take possession of their sees, are made Cardinal Priests, not Cardinal Bishops. Although the incumbents of such prestigious sees are consistently created Cardinal, no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate. Cardinal priest  Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.In modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the cardinal priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin cardo means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel — the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope. While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal\\'s name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled cardinal protopriest. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Paulo Evaristo Arns of Brazil. Cardinal deaconThe cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household and the seven deacons who supervised the Church\\'s works in the districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Thomas J. Reese,  Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church,  Harvard University Press, 1996 p. 92-93  Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II has maintained this ratio. As of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (optazione) after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"title\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest\\'s \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual Urbi et Orbi papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called mitra simplex). Cardinal protodeaconThe Cardinal protodeacon, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals, has the privilege of announcing a new pope\\'s election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate ) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State. In the past, during papal coronations, the Proto-Deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon\\'s privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony.  However, the Proto-Deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. “Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.”  The current Cardinal Proto-Deacon is Jean-Louis Tauran.

He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.  Cardinals who are not bishopsUntil 1917, it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in minor orders, to become a cardinal (see \"lay cardinals\", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests,  and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment.  As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop.  These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but one of them, Roberto Tucci, lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest. A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross and ring). All cardinals traditionally rank above bishops in order of precedence, but those who are not bishops cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as ordination. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves. \"Lay cardinals\"  At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \"lay cardinals\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.  Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.  Cardinals in pectore or secret cardinals  In addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals in pectore (Latin for in the breast).During the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V,  cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, termed creati et reservati in pectore. A cardinal named in pectore is known only to the pope; not even the cardinal so named is necessarily aware of his elevation, and in any event cannot function as a cardinal while his appointment is in pectore. Today, cardinals are named in pectore to protect them or their congregations from reprisals if their identities were known.If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires. Some  speculate that the pope could leave instructions in writing, perhaps in his will, for the appointment to be made known after his death; but it is difficult to imagine a case in which the pope would consider that his own death would remove the obstacle in the way of publishing the name. Of the 232 cardinals that Pope John Paul II elevated, four were named in pectore.   The identities of three of these were subsequently revealed: Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei, Bishop of Shanghai, People\\'s Republic of China - made cardinal 1979, revealed 1991, died 2000. Marian Jaworski, Archbishop of Lviv, Ukraine - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001. Jānis Pujāts, Archbishop of Riga, Latvia - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001. The fourth cardinal was created in 2003. John Paul II did not reveal this cardinal\\'s identity prior to his death, or in the 15-page testament he wrote during his papacy and which was released after his death. Consequently, this cardinalate expired. Some suspect that this \"secret Cardinal\" was Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, a close, longtime friend of John Paul II. However, he was made a cardinal at the March 2006 Consistory anyway, as was announced by Pope Benedict XVI on 22 February 2006. Vesture and privileges   When in choir dress, a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal\\'s willingness to die for his faith. The College of Cardinals General Documentazion     Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates.  Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear simar is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash-like belt). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any \\'trim\\' or piping on it.  It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals\\' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such. Eastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet. In previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom has been discontinued,  and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal\\'s coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel. To symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring,  which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop\\'s episcopal ring). The pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope\\'s coat of arms on the inside. Cardinals have in canon law a \"privilege of forum\" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate ecclesiastical penalty imposed). This does not exempt them from being judged for alleged violations of civil law. The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to another tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Absent such delegation, other ecclesiastical courts, even the Roman Rota, are incompetent to judge a case against a cardinal.

Generally a chronicle ( , from Greek  , from  , chronos, \"time\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.Where a chronicler obtained the information varies; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down. Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts, Memory and Gender in Medieval Europe: 900-1200 (Toronto ; Buffalo : University of Toronto Press, 1999), pp. 19-20   Some made use of written materials; charters, letters, or the works of earlier chroniclers.  Still others are tales of such unknown origins so as to hold mythical status.  Copyists also affected chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original author(s).   The reliability of a particular chronicle is an important determination for modern historians. In modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a universal chronicle. Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A dead chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A live chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as annals, over dead ones.The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. Chronicles are the predecessors of modern \"time lines\" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent continuators. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called annals. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point-of-view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual abbeys.The most important English chronicles are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland (1577–87) by Raphael Holinshed and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.  Later 16th century Scottish chronicles, written after the Reformation, shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be demilitarized and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for UNITA members in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of vigilantism. The FAA is headed by Chief of Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda since 2010, who reports to the Minister of Defense, actually Cândido Pereira Van-Dúnem.There are three components, the Army (Forças Armadas), Navy (Marinha de Guerra) and Air Force Força Aérea Nacional Angolana. Total manpower is about 130,500. (2007). The army is by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.  The Navy numbers about 2,500 and operates seven small patrol craft and barges. Airforce personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes eight Russian-manufactured Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft and transport planes. In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with UNITA forces. A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in Côte d\\'Ivoire, 2010–2011, were not officially confirmed. Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the African Union and has formed special units for this purpose.The Angolan army has around 29,000 \"ghost workers\" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.  Major equipment included over 140 main battle tanks, 600 reconnaissance vehicles, over 320 armored vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles, 298 howitzers carriers. As of 2013, the Army has three military regions and 16 \\'brigades\\', comprising infantry, tanks, APC, artillery, and AA units as required.  The Angolan Navy (MGA) has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4 200 personnel to around 1 000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola’s 1 600 km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways. Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. With regard to procurement, the Navy has a request for a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats. In 1991, the Air Force /Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters. The defense budget in 2005 totaled 1.16 billion US Dollars. Navy Fleet (Marinha de Guerra)Most of the craft detailed are from the 1980s or earlier, but the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s.

A Filmways production created by writer Paul Henning, it is the first in a genre of \" \" themed television shows, and was followed by other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS. In 1963, Henning introduced Petticoat Junction, and in 1965 he reversed the rags to riches model for Green Acres. The show paved the way for later culture-conflict programs such as The Jeffersons, McCloud, The Nanny, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Doc. Panned by many entertainment critics of its time, it quickly became a huge ratings success for most of its nine-year run on CBS.The Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top twenty most watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most watched television episodes of all time. The ongoing popularity of the series spawned a 1993 film remake by 20th Century Fox. In 1997, the episode \"Hedda Hopper\\'s Hollywood\" was ranked #62 on TV Guide\\'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.  OverviewThe Beverly Hillbillies series starts with the OK Oil Company learning of oil in Jed Clampett\\'s swamp land and paying him a fortune to acquire the rights to drill on his land. Patriarch Jed moves with his family into a mansion next door to his banker (Milburn Drysdale) in the wealthy Los Angeles County city of Beverly Hills, California, where he brings a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swanky, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community. The theme song introduces the viewer to the world\\'s most fortunate hunting accident, whereby Jed shoots at game but instead hits \"black gold, Texas tea\": he had discovered oil. Double entendres and cultural misconceptions were the core of the sitcom\\'s humor. Frequently, plots involved the outlandish efforts taken by Drysdale to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank. The family\\'s periodic attempts to return to the mountains were often prompted by Granny due to a perceived slight she received from one of the \"city-folk.\" The Beverly Hillbillies accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. Over a half century since its premiere, the series remains in syndication on MeTV.The Hillbillies themselves were Buddy Ebsen as the widowed patriarch Jed \"J.D.\" Clampett; Irene Ryan as his ornery mother-in-law, Daisy May \"Granny\" Moses; Donna Douglas as his curvaceous, tom-boy daughter Elly May Clampett; and Max Baer, Jr. as Jethro, the brawny, half-witted son of his cousin Pearl Bodine. Pearl (played by Bea Benaderet) appeared in most of the first season episodes, as did Jethro\\'s twin sister Jethrine, played by Baer in drag, using Linda Kaye Henning\\'s voiceover. Pearl was the relative who prodded Jed to move to California, after being told his modest property could yield $25 million.The supporting cast featured Raymond Bailey as Jed\\'s greedy, unscrupulous banker Milburn Drysdale; Harriet E. MacGibbon as Drysdale\\'s ostentatious wife Margaret Drysdale; and Nancy Kulp as \"Miss\" Jane Hathaway, Drysdale\\'s scholarly, \"plain Jane\" secretary, who occasionally pined for the clueless Jethro.While Granny frequently mentioned that she was from Tennessee, the series never specified the state from which the Clampetts moved to California. However, they often referred to nearby towns such as Joplin, Branson, Springfield, Tulsa, Silver Dollar City, all of which are in or near southwest Missouri. In the eighth episode of season 8, named \"Manhattan Hillbillies,\" Granny tells the police officer in Central Park that her family comes from Taney County (which is in southwest Missouri). Early episodes also contained several references to Eureka Springs, which is in northwest Arkansas. All of the communities are in the Ozark Mountains. The show\\'s creator and producer, Paul Henning is from Independence, Missouri, and donated   for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson. A three-act stage play based on the pilot was written by David Rogers in 1968.  Crossovers with related showsTwo episodes of Petticoat Junction feature characters from The Beverly Hillbillies: \"Granny, the Baby Expert\" featuring Granny, and \"A Cake from Granny\" featuring Granny and Miss Jane. Although none of the characters from The Beverly Hillbillies ever appeared on Green Acres, an episode of Green Acres was named after The Beverly Hillbillies.  Irene Ryan, as Granny, appears in the \"Love and the Single Horse\" episode of Mr Ed.  Granny also makes a cameo appearance in the 1966 movie \"Don’t Worry, We’ll Think of a Title\" starring Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie. Theme musicThe show\\'s theme song, \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\", was written by producer and writer Paul Henning and originally performed by bluegrass artists Flatt and Scruggs. The song was sung by Jerry Scoggins (backed by Flatt and Scruggs) over the opening and end credits of each episode. Flatt and Scruggs subsequently cut their own version of the theme (with Flatt singing) for Columbia Records; released as a single, it reached #44 on Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart and #1 on the Billboard Hot Country chart (the lone country chart-topper for the duo).The six main cast members participated on a 1963 Columbia soundtrack album which featured original song numbers in character. Additionally, Ebsen, Ryan, and Douglas each made a few solo recordings following the show\\'s success, including Ryan\\'s 1966 novelty single, \"Granny\\'s Miniskirt.\"The series generally featured no country music beyond the bluegrass banjo theme song, although country star Roy Clark and the team of Flatt and Scruggs occasionally played on the program. Pop singer Pat Boone appeared on one episode as himself, with the premise that he hailed from the same area of the country as the Clampetts, though Boone is a native of Jacksonville, Florida.The 1989 film UHF featured a \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parody music video, \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*,\" combining \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" and English rock band Dire Straits\\' 1985 hit song \"Money for Nothing\". Episodes      ReceptionWritten off as lowbrow by some critics, the show shot to the top of the Nielsen ratings shortly after its premiere and stayed there for several seasons. During its first two seasons, it was the number one program in the U.S. During its second season, it earned some of the highest ratings ever recorded for a half-hour sitcom. The season two episode \"The Giant Jackrabbit\" also became the most watched telecast up to the time of its airing, and remains the most watched half-hour episode of a sitcom as well.  The series enjoyed excellent ratings throughout its run, although it had fallen out of the top 20 most watched shows during its final season. Nielsen ratings Season Years Rank Rating Notes  1 1962–63 1 36.0   2 1963–64 39.1   3 1964–65 12 25.6   4 1965–66 7 25.9 tied with Bewitched  5 1966–67 23.4 tied with Daktari and Bewitched  6 1967–68 12 23.3   7 1968–69 10 23.5   8 1969–70 18 21.7   9 1970–71 Not in the Top 30   Influence on other television shows Because of the show\\'s high ratings, CBS asked creator Paul Henning to pen two more folksy comedies, spawning a mini-genre of rural sitcoms during the 1960s. Petticoat Junction featured an extended family, including three pretty young women of marrying age, running a small hotel in the isolated rural town of Hooterville. Green Acres flipped the Clampetts\\' fish-out-of-water concept by depicting two city sophisticates moving to Hooterville, which was populated by oddball country bumpkins.Certain actors appeared on more than one of these series: Bea Benaderet, who had played Jethro\\'s mother during the first season of The Beverly Hillbillies, was the mother of the family on Petticoat Junction. Linda Kaye Henning, who provided the voiceover for the Beverly Hillbillies character Jethrine, portrayed Benaderet\\'s daughter Betty Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction (the only female who remained all seven seasons). Edgar Buchanan, who starred in all 222 episodes of Petticoat Junction and guest-starred in 17 episodes of Green Acres, also guested in three episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, always as the character Uncle Joe Carson. Charles Lane played Homer Bedloe, vice president of the C. & F. W. Railroad, on both shows.  He also played an apartment landlord to Jane Hathaway (\"Foster Phinney\") during the 1970–71 season. Sam Drucker, played by Frank Cady, of both Petticoat Junction and Green Acres, also appeared in several episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies. Several animal actors trained by Frank Inn, including Higgins the dog, also moved between series as needed. Despite the actor cross-overs and the character Uncle Joe Carson\\'s multiple appearances (which made it clear that the three shows were set in the same fictional universe), the two Hooterville series retained identities that were distinct from The Beverly Hillbillies.

The CBS network, prompted by pressure from advertisers seeking a more sophisticated urban audience, decided to refocus its schedule on several \"hip\" new urban-themed shows and, to make room for them, all of CBS\\'s rural-themed comedies were simultaneously cancelled, despite some considerable Nielsen ratings.  This action came to be known as \"the Rural Purge.\" Pat Buttram, who played Mr Haney on Green Acres, famously remarked that, \"It was the year CBS killed everything with a tree in it.\" In addition to The Beverly Hillbillies, the series that were eliminated included Green Acres, Mayberry R.F.D., and Hee Haw, the last of which was resurrected in first-run syndication, where it ran for another twenty-one years. Petticoat Junction had been canceled a year earlier due to declining ratings following the death of its star, Bea Benaderet. Cast J.D. \"Jed\" ClampettAlthough he had received little formal education, Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen) has a good deal of common sense. A good-natured man, he is the apparent head of the family. Jed\\'s wife (Elly May\\'s mother) died but is referred to in the episode \"Duke Steals A Wife\" as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer. His catchphrase is, \"We-e-e-ell, doggies!\" Jed\\'s full first name is never given in the television series, though \\'Jedediah\\' was used in the 1993 Beverly Hillbillies theatrical movie (coincidentally, on Ebsen\\'s subsequent series, Barnaby Jones, Barnaby\\'s nephew J.R. was also named Jedediah). In one episode Jed and Granny reminisce about seeing Buddy Ebsen and Vilma Ebsen—a joking reference to the Ebsens\\' song and dance act. Jed appears in all 274 episodes. GrannyDaisy May Moses (Irene Ryan), called \"Granny\" by all (relatives or not) is Jed\\'s shotgun-toting mother-in-law and a true daughter of Dixie. Paul Henning, the show\\'s creator/producer quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed\\'s mother, which would have changed the show\\'s dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive but is often overruled by Jed. She is a confederate to the core, defending President Jefferson Davis, the Stars and Bars, and the simple life.  Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a \"dunked\" (not \"sprinkled\") Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors \"revenuers\" and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled \"M.D.\"\\xa0— \"mountain doctor\"\\xa0— she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of anesthesia, Granny uses her \"white lightning\" brew before commencing on painful treatments such as leech bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers.Short and scrappy, Granny often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun and fires it numerous times during the run of the show (in a first-season episode she chases Milburn Drysale with it when she found out his family had a feud with her family back in the hills). She fires it once at the front lawn when Jed is witching for water and several times on the skeet shooting range. During the mock Indian invasion she believed she was shooting live shells, though Milburn Drysdale had removed the buckshot to protect the actors portraying the Indians. She fires rock salt and bacon rind at a crow during the \"Happy Valley\" episode, and again at the back of an armored truck in which Milburn Drysdale was taking refuge in.  She fires at (and hits in the posterior) Milburn Drysdale with rocksalt believing he is the ghost of \"Lady Clemintine\" ending their second visit to \"Clampett Castle\" in Kent, England.Granny also fires \"Lady Fingers\" (which Elly had baked for Jethro to take to the Army Reserve) into the posterior of an actor portraying Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during \"The Battle of Culpepper Plantation\"She is also able to tell the precise time via a sun dial and the weather via a beetle (Granny Versus the Weather Bureau). Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted\\xa0— once in a crossover with the Petticoat Junction show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny\\'s phobias are \"Injuns\" (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts won\\'t be \"scalped\") and the \"cement pond\" (swimming pool–she has a fear of water). In a long story arc in the show\\'s ninth season, Elly May dates a U.S. Navy frogman, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the War Between The States, in which she thinks the South has won and Jefferson Davis is the president, while calling Sherman\\'s March \"Sherman\\'s Retreat to the Sea\". Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his dumb and idiotic schemes.There are references to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: \"When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys\\' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods The Smoky Mountains.\"Granny\\'s full name, Daisy Moses, allegedly an homage to the popular and dearly loved folk artist Anna Mary Robertson, known to the world as Grandma Moses. (Grandma Moses died in 1961, a year before The Beverly Hillbillies made its television debut.) Granny is frequently referred to as \"Granny Clampett\" in a number of episodes but technically she is a Moses. Granny appears in all 274 episodes. Elly May ClampettElly May (Donna Douglas), Jed\\'s only child, is a mountain beauty with the body of a pinup girl and the soul of a tomboy. She can throw a fastball as well as \"rassle\" most men to a fall, and she can be as tender with her friends, animals, and family as she is tough with anyone she rassles. She said once that animals could be better companions than people, but as she grew older she saw that, \"fellas kin be more fun than critters.\" Elly is squired about by eager young Hollywood actors with stage names like \"Dash Riprock\" and \"Bolt Upright.\" Other boyfriends for Elly include Sonny Drysdale, Beau Short, beatnik Sheldon Epps, and Mark Templeton, a frogman.Elly\\'s most notable weakness, oft mentioned when she is being \"courted,\" is her lack of kitchen skills. Family members cringe when, for plot reasons, Elly takes over the kitchen. Rock-like donuts and cookies, for example, are a plot function in an episode featuring Wally Cox as bird watching Professor Biddle.Elly is briefly considered for film stardom at the movie studio owned by Jed. In one episode, hearing Rock Hudson and Cary Grant are both single, Granny asks that Elly be introduced to them.During the final season Elly May takes a job as a secretary at the Commerce Bank after Jed and Granny persuade her that it would be a good way to \"meet a husband.\"In the 1981 TV movie of The Beverly Hillbillies, Elly May is head of a zoo. Elly May appears in all 274 episodes.In addition to the family dog, Duke (an old bloodhound), a number of animals lived on the Clampett estate thanks to animal-lover Elly. These animals were collectively known as her \"critters\". The most prominent pets were chimpanzees, but other animals (from the typical dogs, cats to less-traditional house pets, such as deer, possums, bears, goats, raccoons, kangaroos, etc.) were also occasionally featured. Jethro BodineJethro (Max Baer, Jr.) is the son of Jed\\'s cousin, Pearl Bodine (though he addresses Jed as his uncle). He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro\\'s \"sixth-grade education\" but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and \"go-zin-ta\\'s,\" as in \"five gozinta five one times, five gozinta ten two times,\" etc.  The tallest student in his class in the town of Oxford (so named because \"that\\'s where the oxen used to ford the creek\") because of his age, he is often impressing others that he graduated \"top of his class at Oxford.\"  In Beverly Hills, he decides to go to college. He manages to enroll late in the semester at a local secretarial school due to his financial backing and earns his diploma by the end of the day because he did not understand what was going on in class and was too disruptive. This was an ironic in-joke – in real life, Max Baer, Jr, has a bachelor\\'s degree in business administration from Santa Clara University (he also minored in philosophy).Many stories in the series involve Jethro\\'s endless career search, which include such diverse vocations as a millwright, a brain surgeon, street car conductor, double-naught spy, Hollywood producer (a studio flunky remarks Jethro has the right qualifications for being a producer—a sixth-grade education and his uncle owns the studio. The in-joke gag of Jethro as a movie producer was replayed in the 1981 movie), soda jerk, short order cook, and once as a bookkeeper for Milburn Drysdale\\'s bank. More often than not, his overall goal in these endeavors is to obtain as many pretty girls as humanly possible. Of all the Clampett clan, he is the one who makes the most change from \\'country bumpkin\\' to \\'city boy.\\' Another running gag is that Jethro is known as the \"six-foot stomach\" for his ability to eat: in one episode, he eats a jetliner\\'s entire supply of steaks; in another, Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin \"Bessie\" – with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro. At one time Jed mentions Jethro was the only baby he knew born with a full set of teeth \"just like a beaver\". Jethro appears in 272 episodes; he is not in the third- or second-to-last episodes, but Baer of course remains billed in the title credits. Baer claimed he only auditioned for the role of Jethro for fun and never expected to get the part. Supposedly, he clinched the part largely because of his grin. The DrysdalesMilburn (Raymond Bailey), Margaret (Harriet E. MacGibbon), and Sonny (Louis Nye): The Drysdales are the Clampetts\\' next-door neighbors. Milburn is the Commerce Bank\\'s tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins\\' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale touts a heritage that traces back to the Mayflower, but money-hungry Milburn\\'s concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. In the interest of keeping the Clampetts\\' account at all costs, Mr. Drysdale is prone to appease them and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts by granting their unorthodox requests. Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded Bostonian, has obvious disdain for the \"peasant\" and \"dreadful\" hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever growing account—which is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to $  today). Margaret loathes all four \"vagabonds,\" but her most heated rivalry is with Granny, with whom she occasionally has some \"scraps.\" Raymond Bailey appears in 247 episodes. Harriet E. MacGibbon appears in 55 episodes between 1962 and 1969, she is not seen in the last two seasons of the show although is occasionally mentioned. Margaret\\'s aged father has gambled away most of their money. Mrs. Drysdale\\'s son—and Milburn\\'s stepson—is Sonny (played by Louis Nye), who is a forty-something collegian who doesn\\'t believe in working up a sweat and is an insufferable mama\\'s boy. Finding Elly May a lovely, naive Pollyanna, he courts her until she literally tosses him. Although the character is fondly remembered by fans, Sonny only appears in four episodes, three in 1962 and a final appearance in 1966. Jane HathawayJane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp), whom the Clampetts addressed as \"Miss Jane\", is Drysdale\\'s loyal and efficient secretarial assistant. Though she always carried out his wishes, she was inherently decent and was frequently put off by her boss\\' greed. When she was annoyed with him, as was often the case, especially when one of Drysdale\\'s schemes went too far, she would usually and forcefully say \"Chief!\". Jane was genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she was considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, liked her very much); in fact, she actually harbored something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series\\' run. At first, she mistook the Clampetts as the servants, until she realized who they really were (which almost cost her her job). Miss Hathaway frequently has to \"rescue\" Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, she and Granny, disguised as \"geisha girls\", finally have enough and \"crown\" Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale, as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia \"Ginny\" Jennings (Sheila Kuehl), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings\\' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before. In one episode, it is established that Miss Jane sacrificed her job as the top secretary of the top executive of the top insurance company to join Mr. Drysdale at the Commerce Bank. Miss Jane was a Vassar graduate. Nancy Kulp appears in 246 episodes. In 1999, TV Guide ranked Jane Hathaway #38 on its \"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\" list.  Semiregulars Pearl Bodine Jed\\'s cousin Pearl Bodine, portrayed by Bea Benaderet, was Jethro\\'s widowed mother. In the last season, Granny mentioned that her husband, Fred Bodine, had drowned in a fishing accident when Jethro was just a baby (although, in an earlier episode, Jethro shared some memories of his father with a psychiatrist).  Pearl was a generally well-meaning mother to Jethro. She also was a popular character, often used as a foil for Granny, and became a regular part-way through the first season (the end credits were even refilmed to include Pearl with the other family members). She disappeared after the first year because Benaderet had become the star of another Paul Henning series, Petticoat Junction. Like Elly May, Pearl\\'s name came from that of a character (Pearl Lester) in the popular rural-life novel, play, and film Tobacco Road. Pearl Bodine appears in 22 of the first season\\'s episodes, 1962–63, and later makes a cameo in the 1967 episode \"Greetings From The President\". In the episodes \"The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed\" and \"The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted\" Herbert Rudley plays the psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Twombley. In the episodes Pearl is enamored with Dr. Twombley; Benaderet\\'s real life husband was named Eugene Twombley. The role of Pearl was first offered to Shirley Collie. Jethrine Bodine Jethrine is Pearl\\'s king-sized daughter, Jethro\\'s twin (and is also played by Baer, though voiced by Linda Kaye). Jethrine appears in 11 episodes in 1962–63; she moves with her mother to the Clampett mansion later that season but occasionally is not seen in episodes during her stay in California. Jethrine was upset in leaving the hills as it meant separation from her \"sweetie\", traveling salesman Jazzbo Depew. Late in the season it was explained in an episode that Jethrine had returned home to marry Depew, although the wedding was never seen in the series (nor was Jethrine ever seen again, although she was occasionally referenced). Jethro and Jethrine rarely appeared in the same scene in any of the programs, and then they were never on-camera at the same time except for the rare back-of-the-head shot of one done by a double. Jethrine appears in the 1993 movie version. Dash Riprock Dash, played by Larry Pennell, was the handsome Hollywood actor employed by Jed\\'s movie studio. Elly May and he met while she was working as an extra at the studio. Once Dash saw the beautiful Elly in her bathing suit, he was smitten with her. The two had an on-and-off relationship. In one episode, Mr. Drysdale forced Dash into courting Elly May by threatening to put him in a television show called Crabman. Elly initially liked Dash and enjoyed being with him on dates. Jethro, however, was more enamored with Dash and his playboy persona than was his comely cousin. Riprock was a send-up of the blatantly fake screen names employed by a number of movie actors of the period. Riprock\\'s real name (before being changed by Hollywood moguls) was \"Homer Noodleman,\" and he was from Peoria, Illinois. Dash Riprock was in 10 episodes, mainly between 1965–69. Lowell Redlings Farquhar Lowell is the elderly father of Mrs. Drysdale; Granny considers him a potential beau. Lowell (played by Charles Ruggles) is in three episodes, 1965–66. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs Country music stars Flatt and Scruggs (who play themselves in seven episodes, 1963–68) are longtime friends of the Clampetts \"back home\" (Kimberling City, Missouri) who visit with the Clampetts when they are on tour in California. The duo had a number-one Billboard country single with the show\\'s \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" (although the song is actually performed in the credits by Jerry Scoggins to Flatt and Scruggs\\' instrumental). Actress Joi Lansing played Flatt\\'s wife, Gladys, in five episodes, 1963–68. John Brewster Brewster (played by Frank Wilcox), is the President and CEO of the OK Oil Company, headquartered in Tulsa, who purchases the oil rights to the gusher on the Clampett home back in the hills. The Clampetts are quite fond of him, and his wife occasionally visits them in California. John Brewster appears in 14 episodes, 1962–1966. Janet Trego Janet (played by Sharon Tate) is a beautiful secretary at the Commerce Bank. Although Janet appears in 15 episodes, 1963–65, her role is generally quite minor. Tate was later murdered by Charles Manson\\'s \"family\" just before the start of the eighth season. Sam Drucker Sam (played by Frank Cady) owns the general store in Hooterville. Granny is constantly under the impression Sam wants to marry her, but Sam has no intentions of doing so. He appears in 10 episodes between 1968 and 1970. Cady also starred as Sam Drucker in Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. Cady reprised the role of Sam Drucker for the 1990 Green Acres reunion movie Return to Green Acres. Helen Thompson Helen (played by Danielle Mardi) is a beautiful British secretary at the Commerce Bank. Helen takes over Jane Hathaway\\'s job as Mr. Drysdale\\'s secretary after Ms. Hathaway resigned. Helen appears in 17 episodes between 1969 and 1971. She was one of the ringleaders of the protest group the secretaries of the Commerce Bank created, GRUN (Girls Resist Unfair Neglect). She, along with many other secretaries, as well as Elly and Granny, lived with Ms. Hathaway for a short time in her apartment. Shorty Kellums Shorty (played by Shug Fisher) is Jed\\'s longtime buddy from back home, with whom Jed reunites in 1969 when the Clampetts go back for an extended period to the Hills. Shorty is a wiry little man who is crazy about voluptuous girls half his age. Shorty later moves into the Clampett mansion in Beverly Hills for a period. Shorty Kellums appears in 17 episodes in the 1969–70 season, and returned again briefly during 1970–71. Elverna Bradshaw Elverna is Granny\\'s longtime rival back in the Hills, a gossip second to none. She makes a brief appearance in a 1963 episode when the Clampetts go back to the Hills to fetch Pearl to California, but is not seen again until 1969, when the Clampetts return to their native land for an extended visit. However, both Granny and Jed referred to the character in several episodes throughout the series\\' run. Elverna (played by Elvia Allman) and Granny rekindle their feud in a match to see who will be first wed, Elverna\\'s daughter or Elly May. For reasons not really explained, Elverna also moves into the Clampett Beverly Hills mansion during the same period Shorty does; both of them, however, are gone from the estate for the final 1970–71 season, presumably having returned home. Elverna Bradshaw appears in 13 episodes, 1963–1970. Matthew and Mark Templeton The Templetons are two brothers, both played by actor Roger Torrey, who originally auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the part of Jethro. Matthew is seen in three episodes in October 1969 during the Clampetts\\' stay in the Hills, where Granny tags the preacherman as a prospective husband for Elly. Unfortunately, Granny learns Matthew is married. Just a year later back in California, Elly meets Matthew\\'s brother, Mark Templeton, who is a marine biologist, a frogman, whom Granny believes is actually part frog. The Mark Templeton storyline played out for nine episodes and was abruptly dropped, although advance publicity for the show indicated Elly May and Mark would be marrying during the season; however, the show was cancelled at the end of that season as part of the CBS Rural Purge. StorylinesMost episodes revolved around the clash between the \"uncivilized\" hillbilly culture represented by the Clampetts and the high society American culture of the Drysdales. The Clampetts lived as they always had, even in their large, elegant mansion, never abandoning their mountain attire or replacing the old rattletrap truck in which they had moved to California. Although when asked what kind of truck it is, Jethro said \\'I think it\\'s a Stutz\\', it is actually based on a 1921 Oldsmobile. All the Hillbillies were handy with firearms and always seemed to have their weapons close at hand and ready to draw. They continued to grow their own food, and Granny made lye soap and moonshine. The extreme potency of the moonshine liquor and the harshness of the lye soap were running gags throughout the run of the series.As another running joke, the movie theaters back in the hills were still showing films from the silent movie era and the Hillbillies were unaware of talking pictures or more contemporary movie stars. Granny\\'s favorite actor was Hoot Gibson, but she also had an intense crush on William S. Hart, and the whole Clampett family adored Mary Pickford. Silent movie legend Gloria Swanson made a memorable guest appearance on the show as herself in an episode that featured a comic parody of a silent melodrama. The Clampetts did, however, have a television, on which they watched soap operas and \"rasslin\\'\", as well as John Wayne movies, as he was apparently one of the few \"talkie\" movie stars of whom they were aware. Wayne made a brief cameo as himself after the Clampett mansion was \"attacked\" by stuntmen dressed as Native Americans.Pearl and Granny often fought for kitchen supremacy. Pearl once told Granny \"a blood cousin trumps a mother-in-law\". This underscored a familial disconnect between Jethro and Granny; although they shared no bloodlines, Jethro still called her \"Granny\" (as did everyone else on the show, including Miss Jane and the Drysdales). Other than their kitchen wars, relations between Granny and Pearl were generally friendly. The second season began with a brief mention of Pearl having moved back to the hills, an ironic departure, as it was Pearl who had urged Jed to move to California. The change came about because actress Bea Benaderet had left the show to star in Petticoat Junction. Mrs. Drysdale soon became Granny\\'s main sparring partner.Although both Douglas and Baer were well into their twenties when the series started, during the first years of the series, their characters were supposed to be teenagers. Elly May was enrolled in an elite girls\\' school in the first season, although no further mention was made of her education in later episodes. Jethro was enrolled in a sixth-grade class with much younger students; a few episodes later on, the scripts suggested that he was still in school.Should Granny or one of her kin feel lonely for the hills, banker Drysdale would bend over backwards to placate the offended subject. Drysdale went so far as to recreate the log cabin the Clampetts had lived in and place it right next to the \"cee-ment pond\" and the still Granny had installed to make moonshine. Another time Drysdale followed the Clampetts to the \"Hills\" and bought up the Silver Dollar City \"bank\" just to make sure he had a controlling interest in the Clampetts\\' money. One running gag was that when Jed would take money out of his pocket, Drysdale\\'s blood pressure would go up. A similar running joke was that when it seemed the Clampetts would take their money out of his bank, Drysdale\\'s face would turn green. A variation of the joke of Drysdale\\'s face changing color is in one episode when, after being given some of Granny\\'s \"Tennessee Tranquilizer\" (moonshine), Drysdale\\'s face turns red.Another frequent source of humor dealt with Jethro\\'s endless career search, which included such diverse vocations as soda jerk, brain surgeon, Hollywood celebrity, and secret \"double naught\" agent/spy. Jethro coveted movie star fame and relished becoming a \"playboy\" like Elly\\'s beau Dash Riprock. Jethro\\'s stupidity usually caused such career attempts to fail spectacularly, as when he decided to open a \"topless\" restaurant (\"The Happy Gizzard\"), where the waiters and waitresses were hatless. The one time in the series when Jethro almost succeeded as a \"Hollywood celebrity\" was when \"Cousin Roy\" (Roy Clark) tried to get Jethro to back him up as a country singer in Hollywood; Jethro refused and failed as usual. Jethro did have one success, of sorts. When he rescued a Bird Watchers girl troop who fell into the \"cement pond\" (they were attacked by ants), Jethro got a \"lifesaving badge\".Misunderstandings were a general source of humor in the program, such as when the Clampetts did not understand something they had never encountered before (such as a water faucet), or when various city dwellers could not comprehend something the Clampetts were talking about. A group of businessmen overheard Jed talking about \"crawdads\" and concluded he was discussing a new type of military vehicle, in which they wanted to invest. Conversely, when Jed muses to Mr. Brewster about whether he can afford to move to Beverly Hills, Brewster responds with, \"Why, Mr. Clampett, with your money, you could afford the Taj Mahal\", to which Jed rejoins, \"I\\'ll take it!\" When Brewster insists he was making a joke; Jed allows that he can go right ahead. Brewster: \"Well, that was the joke.\" Jed: \"Mr. Brewster, you\\'re an awfully nice feller, but I\\'ve heard a sight better jokes than that!\"The Clampetts went back to the hills for Christmas during the first season, but did not return there until the eighth season, during which several episodes were filmed on location in Kimberling City, Missouri. During this period, Shug Fisher and Elvia Allman joined the cast as Shorty and Elverna (Allman had appeared on an episode in the first season playing the same character).One constant throughout the series was that the Hillbillies, who were scrupulously honest, were surrounded by cynical, conniving and money-hungry \"city-folk\", whose plans were always foiled (usually unknowingly) by the Clampetts. Reunions 1981 CBS TV movieIn 1981, a Return of the Beverly Hillbillies television movie, written and produced by series creator Paul Henning, was aired on the CBS network. Irene Ryan had died in 1973, and Raymond Bailey had died in 1980. The script acknowledged Granny\\'s passing but featured Imogene Coca as Granny\\'s mother. Max Baer decided against reprising the role that both started and stymied his career, so the character of Jethro Bodine was given to another actor, Ray Young.The film\\'s plot had Jed back in his old homestead in Bug Tussle, having divided his massive fortune among Elly May and Jethro, both of whom stayed on the West Coast. Jane Hathaway had become a Department of Energy agent and was seeking Granny\\'s \"White Lightnin\\'\" recipe to combat the energy crisis. Since Granny had gone on to \"her re-ward\", it was up to Granny\\'s centenarian \"Maw\" (Imogene Coca) to divulge the secret brew\\'s ingredients. Subplots included Jethro playing an egocentric, starlet-starved Hollywood producer, Jane and her boss (Werner Klemperer) having a romance and Elly May owning a large petting zoo. The four main characters finally got together by the end of the story.Having been filmed a mere decade after the final episode of the original series, viewer consensus was that the series\\' original spirit was lost to the film on many fronts, chief of which being the deaths of Ryan and Bailey and Baer\\'s absence, which left only three of the six original cast members available to reprise their respective roles. Further subtracting from the familiarity was the fact that the legendary Clampett mansion was unavailable for a location shoot as the owners\\' lease was too expensive. Henning himself admitted sheer embarrassment when the finished product aired, blaming his inability to rewrite the script due to the 1981 Writers Guild strike.  1993 television specialIn 1993, Ebsen, Douglas, and Baer reunited onscreen for the only time in the CBS-TV retrospective television special, The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies which ranked as the fourth most watched television program of the week—a major surprise given the mediocre rating for the 1981 TV-movie. It was a rare tribute from the \"Tiffany network\", which owed much of its success in the 1960s to the series, but has often seemed embarrassed by it in hindsight, often down-playing the show in retrospective television specials on the network\\'s history and rarely inviting cast members to participate in such all-star broadcasts.The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies special ignored several plot twists of the TV movie, notably Jethro was now not a film director but a leading Los Angeles physician. Critter-loving Elly May was still in California with her animals, but Jed was back home in the Hills, having lost his fortune, stolen by the now-imprisoned banker Drysdale. Nancy Kulp had died in 1991 and was little referred to beyond the multitude of film clips that dotted the special. The special was released on VHS tape by CBS/Fox Video in 1995 and as a bonus feature on the Official Third Season DVD Set in 2009. Reruns and syndicationThe Beverly Hillbillies is still televised daily around the world in syndication. In the United States, the show is broadcast on TV Land and MeTV and was previously on WGN America.  A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the public domain and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks.The show is distributed by CBS Television Distribution, the syndication arm of CBS Television Studios and the CBS network. It was previously distributed by CBS Films, Viacom Enterprises, Paramount Domestic Television, and CBS Paramount Domestic Television (all through corporate changes involving TV distribution rights to the early CBS library). The repeats of the show that debuted on CBS Daytime on September 5–9, 1966 as \"Mornin\\' Beverly Hillbillies\" through September 10, 1971 and on September 13–17, 1971 as \"The Beverly HILLBILLIES\" lasted up to Winter 1971–1972. It aired at 11:00–11:30am Eastern/10:00-10:30am Central through September 3, 1971, then moved to 10:30–11:00am Eastern/9:30-10:00am Central for the last season on CBS Daytime. Media Fifty-five episodes of the series are in the public domain, (all 36 season-one episodes and 19 season-two episodes), because Orion Television, successor to Filmways, neglected to renew their copyrights. As a result, these episodes have been released on home video and DVD on many low-budget labels and shown on low-power television stations and low-budget networks in   prints. In many video prints of the public domain episodes, the original theme music has been replaced by generic music due to copyright issues.Before his death, Paul Henning, whose estate now holds the original film elements to the public domain episodes, authorized MPI Home Video to release the best of the first two seasons on DVD, the first \"ultimate collection\" of which was released in the fall of 2005. These collections include the original, uncut versions of the first season\\'s episodes, complete with their original theme music and opening sponsor plugs. Volume 1 has, among its bonus features, the alternate, unaired version of the pilot film, The Hillbillies Of Beverly Hills (the version of the episode that sold the series to CBS), and the \"cast commercials\" (cast members pitching the products of the show\\'s sponsors) originally shown at the end of each episode. DVD name  No. of episodes Release dates  Region 1  The Ultimate Collection, Volume 1 26 September 27, 2005  With the exception of the public domain episodes, the copyrights to the series were renewed by Orion Television.  However, any new compilation of Hillbillies material will be copyrighted by either MPI Media Group or CBS, depending on the content of the material used.  The trademarks, concepts, and character rights are the exclusive property of CBS Broadcasting. For many years, 20th Century Fox, through a joint venture with CBS called CBS/Fox Video, released select episodes of Hillbillies on videocassette. After Viacom merged with CBS, Paramount Home Entertainment (the video division of Paramount Pictures, which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) took over the video rights.In 2006, Paramount announced plans to release the copyrighted episodes in boxed sets through CBS DVD later that year. The show\\'s second season (consisting of the public domain episodes from that season) was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 7, 2008 as \"...The Official Second Season\". The third season was released on February 17, 2009.  Both seasons are available to be purchased together from major online retailers.

Seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories. Origin and historical locations Early namesake  The Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, also variously known as the Volta Bureau, the Bell Carriage House, the Bell Laboratory and the Volta Laboratory, was created in Washington, D.C. by Alexander Graham Bell.In 1880, the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs (approximately US$10,000 at that time, about $  in current dollars ) for the invention of the telephone, which he used to found the Volta Laboratory, along with Sumner Tainter and Bell\\'s cousin Chichester Bell. Bruce, Robert V. Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-8014-9691-8.  His research laboratory focused on the analysis, recording and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the \"[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\".  The Volta Laboratory and the Volta Bureau were earlier located at Bell\\'s father\\'s house at 1527 35th Street in Washington, D.C., where its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889.  In 1893, Bell constructed a new building (close by at 1537 35th St.) specifically to house it.  The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.       and       Early antecedent In 1884 the American Bell Telephone Company created its Mechanical Department from the Electrical and Patent Department formed a year earlier. Formal organizationIn 1925 Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of the engineering department of the American Telephone & Telegraph company (AT&T) were consolidated to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., as a separate entity. The first president of research was Frank B. Jewett, who stayed there until 1940. The ownership of Bell Laboratories was evenly split between AT&T and the Western Electric Company. Its principal work was to design and support the equipment that Western Electric built for Bell System operating companies, including telephone exchange switches. Support work for the phone companies included the writing and maintaining of the Bell System Practices (BSP), a comprehensive series of technical manuals. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the Bell Telephone Companies, and U.S. government work, including Project Nike and the Apollo program. A few workers were assigned to basic research, and this attracted much attention, especially since they produced several Nobel Prize winners. Until the 1940s, the company\\'s principal locations were in and around the Bell Labs Building in New York City, but many of these were moved to suburban areas of New Jersey.Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were Murray Hill, Holmdel, Crawford Hill, the Deal Test Site, Freehold, Lincroft, Long Branch, Middletown, Neptune, Princeton, Piscataway, Red Bank, and Whippany. Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by Telcordia Technologies and the Whippany site was purchased by Bayer ). The largest grouping of people in the company was in Illinois, at Naperville-Lisle, in the Chicago area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; North Andover, Massachusetts; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania; Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and Westminster, Colorado. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down, or shut down entirely. Discoveries and developmentsAt its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, information theory, the UNIX operating system, the C programming language and the C++ programming language. Seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.  1937: Clinton J. Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter. 1956: John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain, and William Shockley received the Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the first transistors. 1977: Philip W. Anderson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing an improved understanding of the electronic structure of glass and magnetic materials. 1978: Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Penzias and Wilson were cited for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, a nearly uniform glow that fills the Universe in the microwave band of the radio spectrum. 1997: Steven Chu shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light. 1998: Horst Stormer, Robert Laughlin, and Daniel Tsui, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect. 2009: Willard S. Boyle, George E. Smith shared the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Charles K. Kao. Boyle and Smith were cited for the invention of charge-coupled device (CCD) semiconductor imaging sensors. The Turing Award has twice been won by Bell Labs researchers: 1968: Richard Hamming for his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes. 1983: Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie for their work on operating systems theory, and their development of Unix. 1920sDuring its first year of operation, facsimile (fax) transmission, invented elsewhere, was first demonstrated publicly by the Bell Laboratories.  In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example synchronous-sound motion picture system, in competition with Fox Movietone and DeForest Phonofilm. In 1924, Bell Labs physicist Dr. Walter A. Shewhart proposed the control chart as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewart\\'s methods were the basis for statistical process control (SPC)\\xa0— the use of statistically based tools and techniques for the management and improvement of processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including Six Sigma.In 1927, a Bell team headed by Herbert E. Ives successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line television images of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover from Washington to New York. In 1928 the thermal noise in a resistor was first measured by John B. Johnson, and Harry Nyquist provided the theoretical analysis. (This is now referred to as \"Johnson noise\".) During the 1920s, the one-time pad cipher was invented by Gilbert Vernam and Joseph Mauborgne at the laboratories. Bell Labs\\' Claude Shannon later proved that it is unbreakable. 1930sIn 1931, a foundation for radio astronomy was laid by Karl Jansky during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance shortwave communications. He discovered that radio waves were being emitted from the center of the galaxy.  In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski.   In 1933, stereo signals were transmitted live from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. In 1937, the vocoder, the first electronic speech synthesizer was invented and demonstrated by Homer Dudley. Bell researcher Clinton Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with George Paget Thomson for the discovery of electron diffraction, which helped lay the foundation for solid-state electronics. 1940sIn the early 1940s, the photovoltaic cell was developed by Russell Ohl. In 1943, Bell developed SIGSALY, the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as Walter A. Shewhart, W. Edwards Deming, Harold F. Dodge, George Edwards, Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and Mary N. Torrey. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee - Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs\\' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.In 1947, the transistor, probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Bradford Shockley (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, Richard Hamming invented Hamming codes for error detection and correction. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\", one of the founding works in information theory, was published by Claude Shannon in the Bell System Technical Journal. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of modern cryptography with his 1949 paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems. Calculators Model I: A Complex Number Calculator, completed January 1940, for doing calculations of complex numbers. See George Stibitz. Model II: Relay Calculator or Relay Interpolator, September 1943, for aiming anti-aircraft guns Model III: Ballistic Computer, June 1944, for calculations of ballistic trajectories Model IV: Bell Laboratories Relay Calculator, March 1945, a second Ballistic Computer Model V: Bell Laboratories General Purpose Relay Calculator, of which two were built, July 1946 and February 1947, which were general-purpose programmable computers using electromechanical relay Model VI: November 1950, an enhanced Model V 1950sIn 1952 William Gardner Pfann revealed the method of zone melting which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.The 1950s also saw developmental activity based upon information theory. The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories\\' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD Microwave radio relay, Direct Distance Dialing, E-repeaters, Wire spring relays, and improved switching systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the Karnaugh map as a tool to facilitate management of Boolean algebraic expressions. In 1954, The first modern solar cell was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.  A year later, in 1957, MUSIC, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music, was created by Max Mathews. New greedy algorithms developed by Robert C. Prim and Joseph Kruskal, revolutionized computer network design. In 1958, the laser was first described, in a technical paper by Arthur Schawlow and Charles Hard Townes. 1960sIn December 1960, Ali Javan and his associates William Bennett and Donald Heriot successfully operated the first gas laser, the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. Also in 1960, Dawon Kahng and Martin Atalla invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) underlying today\\'s information society. In 1962, the electret microphone was invented by Gerhard M. Sessler and James Edward Maceo West. In 1964, the Carbon dioxide laser was invented by Kumar Patel. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, Molecular beam epitaxy was developed by J.R. Arthur and A.Y. Cho; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, the UNIX operating system was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. From 1969 to 1971, Aaron Marcus, the first graphic designer in the world to work with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone (TM). The Charge-coupled device (CCD) was invented in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the New York City site was sold and became the Westbeth Artists Community complex. 1970sThe 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the personal computing revolution. In 1972 Dennis Ritchie developed the compiled C programming language as a replacement for the interpretive B which was then used in rewriting the UNIX operating system (also developed at Bell Laboratories by Ritchie and Ken Thompson).  Additionally, the AWK programming language was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.In 1970, A. Michael Noll patented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by Erna Schneider Hoover, who received one of the first software patents for it. In 1976, Fiber optics systems were first tested in Georgia and in 1980, the first single-chip 32-bit microprocessor, the BELLMAC-32A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor-transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; 1A/ Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced the floor space required. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that required only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).   1980sIn 1980, the TDMA and CDMA digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, Fractional quantum Hall effect was discovered by Horst Störmer and former Bell Laboratories researchers Robert B. Laughlin and Daniel C. Tsui; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1986, the C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the original C programming language also developed at Bell Laboratories.In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. In 1984, the Karmarkar Linear Programming Algorithm was developed by mathematician Narendra Karmarkar. Also in 1984, a divestiture agreement signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created local exchange carriers. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. became a wholly owned company of the new AT&T Technologies unit, the former Western Electric. The 5ESS Switch was developed during this transition. In 1985, laser cooling was used to slow and manipulate atoms by Steven Chu and team. In 1985, the AMPL modeling language was developed by Robert Fourer, David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the National Medal of Technology \"For contribution over decades to modern communication systems\". During the 1980s, the Plan 9 operating system was developed as a replacement for Unix which was also developed at Bell Laboratories in 1969. Development of the Radiodrum, a three dimensional electronic instrument . In 1988, TAT-8 became the first fiber optic transatlantic cable. 1990s In 1990, WaveLAN, the first wireless local area network (WLAN) was developed at Bell Laboratories. In 1991, the 56K modem technology was patented by Nuri Dağdeviren and his team. In 1994, the quantum cascade laser was invented by Federico Capasso, Alfred Cho, Jerome Faist and their collaborators and was later greatly improved by the innovations of Claire Gmachl. Also in 1994, Peter Shor devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron lithography, which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The Inferno operating system, an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the new concurrent Limbo programming language. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form. AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment-manufacturing business, into a new company named Lucent Technologies. AT&T retained a smaller number of researchers, who made up the staff of the newly created AT&T Labs. In 1997, the smallest practical transistor (60 nanometers, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first optical router was invented  . 2000s 2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which DNA machine prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered organic laser invented; a large-scale map of cosmic dark matter was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes plastic transistors possible, was invented. In 2002, physicist Jan Hendrik Schön was fired after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.In 2003, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at Murray Hill, New Jersey. In 2005, Dr. Jeong Kim, former President of Lucent\\'s Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.In April 2006, Bell Laboratories\\' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with Alcatel. On December 1, 2006, the merged company, Alcatel-Lucent, began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories\\' and Lucent\\'s sensitive U.S. Government contracts.In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics basic research, according to a report by the scientific journal Nature. On August 28, 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.

Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their Swahili names by the Comorian government. They are Grande Comore (Njazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzwani), and Mayotte (Mahoré). The islands\\' distance from each other—Grande Comore is some 200 kilometers from Mayotte, forty kilometers from Mohéli, and eighty kilometers from Grande Comore—along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. The islands have a total land area of 2,236 square kilometers (including Mayotte), and claim territorial waters of 320 square kilometers. Mount Karthala (2316 m) on Grande Comore is an active volcano.  From April 17 to 19, 2005, the volcano began spewing ash and gas, forcing as many as 10,000 people to flee.Geographic coordinates:   Grande ComoreGrande Comore is the largest island, sixty-seven kilometers long and twenty-seven kilometers wide, with a total area of 1,146 square kilometers. The most recently formed of the four islands in the archipelago, it is also of volcanic origin. Two volcanoes form the island\\'s most prominent topographic features: La Grille in the north, with an elevation of 1,000 meters, is extinct and largely eroded; Kartala in the south, rising to a height of 2,361 meters, last erupted in 1977. A plateau averaging 600 to 700 meters high connects the two mountains. Because Grande Comore is geologically a relatively new island, its soil is thin and rocky and cannot hold water. As a result, water from the island\\'s heavy rainfall must be stored in catchment tanks. There are no coral reefs along the coast, and the island lacks a good harbor for ships. One of the largest remnants of Comoros\\' once-extensive rain forests is on the slopes of Kartala. The national capital has been at Moroni since 1962. AnjouanAnjouan, triangular shaped and forty kilometers from apex to base, has an area of 424 square kilometers. Three mountain chains—Sima, Nioumakele, and Jimilime—emanate from a central peak, Mtingui (1,575 m), giving the island its distinctive shape. Older than Grande Comore, Anjouan has deeper soil cover, but overcultivation has caused serious erosion. A coral reef lies close to shore; the island\\'s capital of Mutsamudu is also its main port. MohéliMohéli is thirty kilometers long and twelve kilometers wide, with an area of 290 square kilometers. It is the smallest of the four islands and has a central mountain chain reaching 860 meters at its highest. Like Grande Comore, it retains stands of rain forest. Mohéli\\'s capital is Fomboni. MayotteMayotte, geologically the oldest of the four islands, is thirty-nine kilometers long and twenty-two kilometers wide, totaling 375 square kilometers, and its highest points are between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. Because of greater weathering of the volcanic rock, the soil is relatively rich in some areas. A well-developed coral reef that encircles much of the island ensures protection for ships and a habitat for fish. Dzaoudzi, capital of Comoros until 1962 and now Mayotte\\'s administrative center, is situated on a rocky outcropping off the east shore of the main island. Dzaoudzi is linked by a causeway to le Pamanzi, which at ten kilometers in area is the largest of several islets adjacent to Mayotte. Islets are also scattered in the coastal waters of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli. Flora and faunaComorian waters are the habitat of the coelacanth, a rare fish with limblike fins and a cartilaginous skeleton, the fossil remains of which date as far back as 400 million years and which was once thought to have become extinct about 70 million years ago.  A live specimen was caught in 1938 off southern Africa; other coelacanths have since been found in the vicinity of the Comoro Islands.Several mammals are unique to the islands themselves.  Livingstone\\'s fruit bat, although plentiful when discovered by explorer David Livingstone in 1863, has been reduced to a population of about 120, entirely on Anjouan.  The world\\'s largest bat, the jet-black Livingstone fruit bat has a wingspan of nearly two meters.  A British preservation group sent an expedition to Comoros in 1992 to bring some of the bats to Britain to establish a breeding population.A hybrid of the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) originally from Madagascar, was introduced prior by humans prior to European colonization and is found on Mayotte.   The mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), also introduced from Madagascar by humans, can be found on the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan. 22 species of bird are unique to the archipelago and 17 of these are restricted to the Union of the Comoros. These include the Karthala Scops-owl, Anjouan Scops-owl and Humblot\\'s Flycatcher. Partly in response to international pressures, Comorians in the 1990s have become more concerned about the environment.  Steps are being taken not only to preserve the rare fauna, but also to counteract degradation of the environment, especially on densely populated Anjouan.  Specifically, to minimize the cutting down of trees for fuel, kerosene is being subsidized, and efforts are being made to replace the loss of the forest cover caused by ylang-ylang distillation for perfume.  The Community Development Support Fund, sponsored by the International Development Association (IDA, a World Bank affiliate) and the Comorian government, is working to improve water supply on the islands as well. Climate The climate is marine tropical, with two seasons: hot and humid from November to April, the result of the northeastern monsoon, and a cooler, drier season the rest of the year. Average monthly temperatures range from   along the coasts. Although the average annual precipitation is  , water is a scarce commodity in many parts of Comoros. Mohéli and Mayotte possess streams and other natural sources of water, but Grande Comore and Anjouan, whose mountainous landscapes retain water poorly, are almost devoid of naturally occurring running water. Cyclones, occurring during the hot and wet season, can cause extensive damage, especially in coastal areas. On the average, at least twice each decade houses, farms, and harbor facilities are devastated by these great storms. Extreme points This is a list of the extreme points of Comoros, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location. This list excludes the French-administered island of Mayotte which is claimed by the Comorian government.

    "document_6 = '3085\\tAlexandria Troas   Alexandria Troas (\"Alexandria of the Troad\", modern  ) is an ancient Greek city situated on the Aegean Sea near the northern tip of Turkey\\'s western coast, a little south of Tenedos (modern Bozcaada). It is located in the modern Turkish province of Çanakkale. The site sprawls over an estimated  ; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined bath, an odeon, a theatre and gymnasium complex John Freely (2003). The Aegean Coast of Turkey. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8.  and a recently uncovered stadium.   The circuit of the old walls can still be traced. History HellenisticAccording to Strabo, this site was first called Sigeia;  around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, Jona Lendering (2006). Alexandria in Troas (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15.  including the once influential city of Neandria. Robert Jewett (2005). The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion. Retrieved 2010-4-15.  Its name was changed by Lysimachus to Alexandria Troas, in memory of Alexander III of Macedon (Pliny merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria ). As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a \"free and autonomous city\" as early as 188 BC,  and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday, the city may have had a population of about 100,000.  Strabo mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, Hadrian and the rich grammarian Herodes Atticus contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. Constantine considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire. RomanIn Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe. Paul of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas  and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred ). Ignatius of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.  ByzantineSeveral of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the Patriarch Ignatius, and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy (Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, 552; Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani, 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, Troadensis; the seat is vacant following the resignation of the last bishop in 1971. Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The most recent hierarch, His Grace Bishop Savas (Zembillas) of Troas,  served 2002-2011. He is now Metropolitan Savas (Zembillas) of Pittsburgh in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.  OttomanKarasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their beylik was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as Eski Stambul, the \"Old City\".  The site\\'s stones were much plundered for building material (for example Mehmed IV took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul). As of the mid-18th century the site served as \"a lurking place for bandetti\".  ModernBy 1911 the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals. Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as Bal Saray (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135.  Trajan built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. It is the subject of a recent study by German archaeologists who are digging and surveying at the site. Their excavation has uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.

He was the son of Satyrus and Stratocleia, and was a native of Pleuron in Aetolia, although he spent the greater part of his life at Alexandria, where he was reckoned one of the seven tragic poets who constituted the Tragic Pleiad.      He flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus.He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant.  He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.   Notwithstanding the distinction he enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.  Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the Fisherman,  Kirka or Krika,  which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and Helena,   Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.       His Cynaedi, or Ionic poems ( ), are mentioned by Strabo  and Athenaeus.   Some anapaestic verses in praise of Euripides are preserved in Gellius.

An arrangement may include reharmonization, paraphrasing, and/or development of a composition, so that it fully represents the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure\".  Orchestration differs in that it is only adapting music for an orchestra or musical ensemble while arranging \"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings...Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\" (ibid). Classical musicArrangements and transcriptions of classical and serious music go back to the early history of this genre. In particular music written for the piano frequently underwent this treatment.  The suite of ten piano pieces Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky, has been arranged over twenty times, perhaps the most famous and notable being that of Maurice Ravel.  Due to his lack of expertise in orchestration, the American composer George Gershwin had his Rhapsody in Blue orchestrated and arranged by Ferde Grofé.  Popular musicArrangers in pop music recordings often add parts for orchestral or band instruments involving new material such that the arrangers may reasonably be considered co-composers, although for copyright and royalty purposes usually are not.  Rhythm section parts are usually improvised or otherwise invented by the performers themselves using chord symbols or a lead sheet as a guide.  (Rhythm section instruments usually include guitars, bass guitars, string basses, piano and other keyboard instruments, and drums.)An existing pop song can be re-recorded with a different arrangement to the original. As well as different instruments, the tempo, time signature and key signature may be altered, sometimes drastically so. The end result is a song that retains familiar phrases and lyrics, but offers something new.  This practice was particularly popular in the late 1960s. Well known examples of this include Joe Cocker\\'s version of The Beatles\\' With a Little Help from My Friends, and Ike And Tina Turner\\'s version of Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s Proud Mary. The American group Vanilla Fudge and British group Yes based their early careers on radical re-arrangements of contemporary hits.  Another and later example would be Bonnie Pointer\\'s disco and Motown-themed versions of \"Heaven Must Have Sent You.\"Some remixes, particularly in dance music, can also be considered re-arrangements in this style. Jonathan Tunick is the most prominent arranger, being one of only twelve people to have won Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, and Tony awards.  Jazz  In jazz an unscored collaborative arrangement is called a \"head arrangement\" (Randel 2002, p.\\xa0294; it is in the head of the musician(s)). Big bands such as those of Duke Ellington (at the very beginning of his career), Bennie Moten, and Count Basie performed head arrangements (ibid).Arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal, minimal, and uncredited. This was particularly so for combos in the bebop era. In general, the larger the ensemble, the greater the need for a formal arrangement, although the early Count Basie big band was famous for its head arrangements, so called because they were worked out by the players themselves, memorized immediately and never written down. Most arrangements for large ensembles, big bands, in the swing era, were written down, however, and credited to a specific arranger, as were later arrangements for the Count Basie big band by Sammy Nestico and Neal Hefti. Don Redman made significant innovations in the pattern of arrangement in Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra in the 1920s. He introduced the pattern of arranging melodies in the body of arrangements and arranging section performances of the big band. Benny Carter became Fletcher\\'s main arranger in the early 30\\'s, moving on become as famous for his arranging expertise as his musicianship. Billy Strayhorn was an arranger of great renown in the Duke Ellington orchestra beginning in 1938.Jelly Roll Morton is considered the earliest jazz arranger, writing down the parts when he was touring about 1912-1915 so that pick-up bands could play his compositions. Big band arrangements are informally called charts. In the swing era they were usually either arrangements of popular songs or they were entirely new compositions. Duke Ellington\\'s and Billy Strayhorn\\'s arrangements for the Duke Ellington big band were usually new compositions, and some of Eddie Sauter\\'s arrangements for the Benny Goodman band and Artie Shaw\\'s arrangements for his own band were new compositions as well. It became more common to arrange sketchy jazz combo compositions for big band after the bop era. After 1950, the big bands declined in number. However, several bands continued and arrangers provided renowned arrangements. Gil Evans wrote a number of large-ensemble arrangements in the late fifties and early sixties intended for recording sessions only.  Other arrangers of note include Vic Schoen, Pete Rugolo, Oliver Nelson, Johnny Richards, Billy May, Thad Jones, Maria Schneider, Bob Brookmeyer, Steve Sample, Sr, Lou Marini, Nelson Riddle, Ralph Burns, Billy Byers, Gordon Jenkins, Ray Conniff, Henry Mancini, and Ray Reach.In the 21st century, the Big Band arrangement has made a modest comeback. Gordon Goodwin, Roy Hargrove, and Christian McBride have all rolled out New Big Bands with both original compositions and new arrangements of standard tunes.   Arranging for instrumental groups StringsThe string section is a body of instruments composed of various stringed instruments. By the 19th century orchestral music in Europe had standardized the string section into the following homogeneous instrumental groups: first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses. The string section in a multi-sectioned orchestra is referred sometimes to as the “string choir.”  The harp is also a stringed instrument, but is not a member of or homogenous with the violin family and is not considered part of the string choir. Samuel Adler classifies the harp as a plucked string instrument in the same category as the guitar (acoustic or electric), mandolin, banjo, or zither.   Like the harp these instruments do not belong to the violin family and are not homogenous with the string choir. In modern arranging these instruments are considered part of the rhythm section. The electric string bass and upright string bass—depending on the circumstance—can be treated by the arranger as either string section or rhythm section instruments.  A group of instruments in which each member plays a unique part—rather than playing in unison with other like instruments—is referred to as a chamber ensemble.   A chamber ensemble made up entirely of strings of the violin family is referred to by its size. A string trio consists of three players, a string quartet four, a string quintet five, and so on. In most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one homogenous unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than improvise.A string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra)   or in conjunction with any of the other instrumental sections. More than one string orchestra can be utilized.A standard string section (vln., vln 2., vla., vcl, cb.) with each section playing unison allows the arranger to create a five-part texture. Often an arranger will divide each violin section in half or thirds to achieve a denser texture. It is possible to carry this division to its logical extreme in which each member of the string section plays his or her own unique part. Size of the string sectionArtistic, budgetary and logistical concerns will determine the size and instrumentation of a string section. Due to the large percussion section utilized in the Broadway musical West Side Story, composer Leonard Bernstein chose to utilize a string section without violas.  George Martin, producer and arranger for The Beatles, warns arrangers about the intonation issues when only two like instruments play in unison. \"After a string quartet,\" Martin explains, \"I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line...as a rule two stringed instruments together create a slight \"beat\" which does not give a smooth sound.\"  While any combination and number of string instruments is possible in a section, a traditional string section sound is achieved with a violin-heavy balance of instruments.

It is in adapted ottava rima and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly alliteration. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of Hamlet, craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.The Triumph of Time is also the US title of James Blish\\'s novel A Clash of Cymbals.

It was formed in 1977, by a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, after having secured former Liberal minister Don Chipp as a high-profile leader.  The party\\'s 30-year representation in the Parliament of Australia ended on 30 June 2008, after the loss of its four remaining Senate seats; two of the senators had retired from politics and the other two were defeated at the 2007 election, in which the party polled only 1.29% of the national Senate vote.   The party is based on the principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and direct democracy through postal ballots of all members, so that \"there should be no hierarchical structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members.\" Chipp D and Larkin J The Third Man Rigby, Melbourne (1978) ISBN 0-7270-0827-7   From the outset, members\\' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party ombudsman and membership ballot.Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and sustainability, opposition to the primacy of economic rationalism (Australian neoliberalism), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of green politics at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the cause célèbre of the Franklin River Dam.The party\\'s centrist role makes it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp\\'s former conservative affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left. Such as the then Socialist Workers\\' Party and early green-left parties such as the United Tasmania Group.  This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party\\'s founders. The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader Janet Powell in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993, decision of the party\\'s national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members\\' National Journal and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material. Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the ACT, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as Senate seats in all six states. However, at the 2004 and 2007 elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.  History 1977–79 On the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a Centre-Line Party, which Chipp was invited to lead  —but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. The Centre-Line Party was the provisional title of the Australian Democrats party.    The occasion was a meeting at the Perth Town Hall to which Don Chipp had been invited in the hope that he would accept the position of leader of the new party, which would be an amalgamation of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement. On that occasion, Chipp declined to commit himself but did so at a corresponding public meeting in Melbourne on 9 May 1977. Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister John Gorton, and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee.   The new party was eventually renamed the Australian Democrats by a ballot of its membership. \"Fifty-six suggestions produced by members were listed on the ballot paper, including Uniting Australia Party, Australian Centre Line Party, Dinkum Democrats, Practical Idealists of Australia and People for Sanity Party!! After the ballot, the suggestion of the Steering Committee, \\'Australian Democrats\\', was overwhelmingly accepted.\"   The name \"Australian Democrats\" was already in informal currency before this decision. The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator Janine Haines who filled Steele Hall\\'s casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the 1977 federal elections after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since 1969 and the Liberal Movement, in 1974 and 1975. The party\\'s broad aim was to achieve a balance of power in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.The grassroot support attracted by Chipp\\'s leadership was measurable at the party\\'s first electoral test at the 1977 federal election on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required quota was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and Colin Mason (NSW). 1980–82At a Melbourne media conference in 1980, Chipp described his party\\'s aim as to \"keep the bastards honest\"—the \"bastards\" being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.The Australian Democrats\\' first national conference, on 16–17 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir Mark Oliphant, who said:  I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party.    At the October 1980 election, the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing Janine Haines (SA) and two new senators Michael Macklin (Qld) and John Siddons (Vic), bringing the party\\'s strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .A South Australian by-election in the state seat of Mitcham (now Waite) in 1982 saw Heather Southcott retain the seat for the Democrats from Robin Millhouse since 1955 (Democrat since 1977), however it was lost later that year at the 1982 state election. Mitcham was the only single-member lower house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats. 1987–90 It had been expected that the Democrats would find it difficult to win seats at the next Senate election due in 1987. However, their task was assisted by the calling of a double dissolution election by Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. This reduced the quota necessary to win a seat to 7.7%. In NSW (Paul McLean), Victoria (Janet Powell) and South Australia (Janine Haines), 6 year terms were won. In South Australia, a second senator (John Coulter) was elected to 3 year term, and short terms were also won Michael Macklin in Queensland and Jean Jenkins in Western Australia. 1990–91  See \\'Give a Damn: Vote Democrat 1\\' campaign commercial 1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the narrow failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat known as the Division of Kingston.Her casual vacancy was filled by Meg Lees several months before the arrival of Cheryl Kernot, elected to replace the retiring deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the Senate leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.  In the event, Victorian Janet Powell was elected as leader and John Coulter was chosen as deputy leader.Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic recession was building, and events such as the Gulf War in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas. Election Results Senate – National  1977: 11.1% 1980:  9.3% 1983:  9.6% 1984:  7.6% 1987:  8.5% 1990: 12.6% 1993:  5.3% 1996: 10.8% 1998:  8.4% 2001:  7.3% 2004:  2.1% 2007:  1.3% 2010:  0.6%   Virtually alone on the Australian political landscape, Janet Powell consistently attacked both the government and opposition which had closed ranks in support of the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was thus able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia\\'s participation, The sole independent member in the House, Ted Mack, was unable to launch his critical motion for lack of a seconder.   the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate. Possibly because of the party\\'s opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party\\'s standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party\\'s first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell\\'s alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative media \\'leaks\\' concerning her openly established relationship with Sid Spindler and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy John Coulter. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip Paul McLean who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by Karin Sowada. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens. PolicyThe party\\'s original support base consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial conflict between the two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people with a desire to participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for environmental protection and social justice. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly neo-Keynesian economics and a progressive environmental platform.The original agenda included interventionist economic policies, commitment to environmental causes, support for   with Australia\\'s indigenous population through such mechanisms as formal treaties, pacifist approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for human rights and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised tertiary-educated and middle-class constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammelled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.The party has a platform of participatory democracy, with policies supporting proportional representation and citizen-initiated referenda. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community\\'s growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party\\'s journals, obtainable in major public libraries.In 2009, as part of the Rebuild process, the party announced a comprehensive review of all policies.  Electoral fortunes  The Australian Democrats\\' electoral fortunes have fluctuated throughout their history.During the Hawke and Keating Labor Governments (1983–96), the Australian Democrats held a theoretical balance of power in the Senate: the numbers were such that they could team with Labor to pass legislation, or team with the Coalition to block legislation on occasions when the Coalition decided to oppose a government bill.Their power was weakened in 1996 after the Howard Government was elected, and a Labor senator, Mal Colston, resigned from the Labor party. This meant that the Australian Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators. As a result, the Coalition government could often bypass the Australian Democrats, and pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and Brian Harradine. Following the 1998 election the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at the 2004 election.The Hawke and Keating governments pursued economic policies that drew on economic rationalist and neo-liberal thought, and the Australian Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government, and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics. Their appeal (and focus on issues beyond the usual \"economic\" ones that monopolised major party attention) was always greatest amongst tertiary-educated voters. However, the party\\'s progressive politics also remained attractive to a sizeable section of mainly middle class (\"wet\") Liberal supporters – often female, and often disparagingly described on the right of the Liberal Party as \"Soccer Mums\"  or \"Doctor\\'s Wives\" – who were turned off by the Liberal party\\'s social conservatism and \"Reagonomic/Thatcherite\" economic policies. Many Liberals saw their support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate as having \"an each way bet\", ameliorating the effect of their support for the Liberals in the House of Representatives – an attitude positively fostered, not unsurprisingly, by Democrat politicians and campaigners.Cheryl Kernot became leader in 1993. She had strong media appeal, which increased media and public awareness of herself and the party. She was known to have interests in industrial relations and was able to cultivate solid relationships with Labor government frontbenchers, which also added to her credibility in the press gallery.Lack of clear direction other than, possibly, senators\\' common ambition to play a more productive role in government manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot\\'s policy on industrial relations (see the Workplace Relations Act 1996). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Australian Democrats voted for the Howard Government\\'s right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts. Kernot, however, remained broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role and contribution to strategy in government,  led her to defect to the ALP in 1997. Her replacement as leader was by long-serving deputy, Meg Lees. Under Lees\\' leadership, in the 1998 federal election, the Democrats\\' candidate John Schumann came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister Alexander Downer\\'s seat of Mayo in the Adelaide Hills under Australia\\'s preferential voting system.  The party\\'s Senate representation increased to nine Senators.Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party\\'s support for the Government\\'s Goods and Services Tax (GST), was damaging to the Democrats.Opposed by the Labor Party, the Australian Greens and independent Senator Brian Harradine, the GST required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package or the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan \"No GST on food\".  In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister Howard, Meg Lees, Andrew Murray and the party room Senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation  with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions.   Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour.  However, two dissident senators on the party\\'s left Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett voted against the GST.   In 2001, a leadership spill saw Meg Lees replaced as leader  by Natasha Stott Despoja after a very public and bitter leadership battle.  Despite criticism of Stott Despoja\\'s youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election.  Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats\\' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of Vicki Bourne\\'s Senate seat in NSW.Resulting tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to Meg Lees leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the Australian Progressive Alliance.  Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues.  It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader.On 6 December 2003, Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris on the floor of Parliament while intoxicated.  The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader Lyn Allison would serve as the Acting Leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol. 2004  Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the 2004 federal election in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban Adelaide in South Australia, where they received between 7 and 31 per cent of the Lower House vote in 2001, and between 1 and 4 per cent in 2004. Three incumbent senators were defeated—Aden Ridgeway (NSW), Brian Greig (WA) and John Cherry (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Lyn Allison as leader and Andrew Bartlett as her deputy.From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980. 2006On 5 January 2006, the ABC reported that the Tasmanian Electoral Commission had de-registered that division of the party for failing to provide a list containing the required number of members to be registered for Tasmanian state and local elections. On 18 March 2006, at the 2006 South Australian state election, the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, Kate Reynolds, was defeated.After the election, South Australian senator Natasha Stott Despoja denied rumours that she was considering quitting the party. In early July, Richard Pascoe, national and South Australian party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader Sandra Kanck\\'s comments regarding the drug MDMA which he saw as damaging to the party.   On 5 July 2006, Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia Andrew Murray announced his intention not to contest the 2007 federal election, citing frustration arising from the Howard Government\\'s control of both houses and his unwillingness to serve another six-year term.  His term ended on 30 June 2008.On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: \"... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats.  \"On 22 October 2006, Australian Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja announced her intention not to seek re-election at the 2007 federal election due to health concerns.  Her term ended on 30 June 2008.In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%,  less than half of the party\\'s result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).  2007In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, Arthur Chesterfield-Evans. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. A higher vote was achieved in some of the Legislative Assembly seats selectively contested as compared to 2003. However, the statewide vote share fell because the party was unable to field as many candidates as in 2003.In the Victorian state by-election in Albert Park District  the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled a respectable 5.75 per cent of the primary vote, despite a large number of candidates, and all media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates.On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered  by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.The Democrats had no success at the 2007 federal election. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and Andrew Bartlett (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), did not run for new terms. All four senators\\' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977. An ABC report noted that \"on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website the party is now referred to just as \\'other\\'\".  2008The party achieved only 1.24% of the vote at the federal 2008 Mayo by-election in South Australia. At the Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008, the party\\'s ungrouped candidates  obtained 0.3% of the vote for Ginninderra  (Darren Churchill) and 0.2% in Molonglo  (Greg Tannahill). 2009In January 2009, South Australian MLC, Sandra Kanck retired after 15 years in Parliament. She was replaced by her media adviser, David Winderlich.  In July 2009, David Winderlich, announced he would leave the party and sit as an independent unless the South Australian Democrats could recruit 1,000 new members by November 2009.  When this clearly could not eventuate, he resigned from the party on 7 October 2009, continued to sit as an independent  and was defeated at the 2010 election, in which the Democrats polled less than one percent of the Upper House vote in their registered home state. During the year, the party attempted to reconstruct by reducing membership fees.  In December, former staffer David Collyer contested the federal 2009 Higgins by-election and received 2.3 percent of the vote,  a tally which was exceeded by those of the Greens (32.4%), the DLP (3.85%) and the newly founded Sex Party (3.21%). 2010The South Australian Democrats contested the state election on 20 March 2010. The lead Legislative Council candidate was animal rights activist and former independent, Jeanie Walker  with supporting candidates Tom Salerno and Sandra Kanck  They attracted 0.9% of the total primary vote.  However, on preferences, Jeanie Walker survived until the 35th round of counting, losing to micro-party Dignity for Disability\\'s Kelly Vincent who was elected in the 43rd round.  Eight House of Assembly seats were also contested, averaging 2.24 per cent of the vote in those seats.At the 2010 federal election, Democrat candidates again failed to secure a Senate seat. They polled very poorly, achieving only 0.63% of the national vote,  their best divisional result being 1.77%  in the ACT. 2012In March 2012, the Australian Electoral Commission queried a Democrats submission of 550 names of purported members and proposed deregistering the party for having fewer than 500 members, the threshold needed for registration.  The party survived this inquiry, the Commission finding that the party had a sufficient membership number to continue registration. The party executive has committed to contesting the next Australian federal election.  The Northern Territory was accorded a formal status as part of the division of Western Australia. In July 2012, former WA senator Brian Greig was elected national president \"to resurrect the Australian Democrats as they attempt to take advantage of present political unrest\".  Trenwith, Courtney Democrats\\' comeback inspired by \\'inflexible\\' Greens Sydney Morning Herald, 21 July 2012  However, he left the position two months later, and the party\\'s national secretary reported \"severe friction\" within the party. The Democrats won 10.8 percent of the vote at the 2012 Heffron state by-election coming third of four candidates in the absence of a Liberal Party candidate. On the 11th of December 2012 the National Executive expelled former South Australian MLC, Sandra Kanck, following continued dissatisfaction with Ms Kanck’s attempts to close and/or merge the Australian Democrats with various population abatement groups that Ms Kanck heads or is affiliated with.   SupportSupport for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 per cent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense CBD and inner-suburban neighbourhoods of the capital cities (especially Adelaide). Therefore, they never managed to win a House of Representatives seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two Senate seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments.  Following the internal conflict over GST (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats\\' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the Australian Greens who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial third party. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al.  Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback in the federal arena. Following Tony Abbott\\'s displacement of Malcolm Turnbull as federal leader of the Liberal Party in 2009, the Democrats sought to attract the support of \"those Liberals who no longer feel they can support their party\".  Federal parliamentary leadersOf the party\\'s nine elected federal parliamentary leaders, six were women. Aboriginal senator Aden Ridgeway was deputy leader under Natasha Stott Despoja.

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy, and is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology. Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as   (after 1761 Carolus a Linné).Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. Linnaeus received most of his higher education at Uppsala University, and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his   in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.The Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth.\"    The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\"  Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist\".    Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called   (Prince of Botanists), \"The Pliny of the North,\" and \"The Second Adam\". Broberg (2006), p. 7. In botany, the author abbreviation used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species\\' names is L.  In 1959, Carl Linnaeus was designated as the lectotype for Homo sapiens,  which means that following the nomenclatural rules, Homo sapiens was validly defined as the animal species to which Linnaeus belonged. Biography Early life ChildhoodCarl Linnaeus was born in the village of Råshult in Småland, Sweden on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus and Christina Brodersonia. His father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the University of Lund, he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant linden tree (or lime tree),   in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead. Blunt (2004), p. 12.  This name was spelled with the æ ligature. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father\\'s family name. The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications. Blunt (2004), p. 13.  Carl\\'s patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus.One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur botanist, a Lutheran minister, and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. She subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son, Samuel (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping).  Stöver (1974), p. 8.  Broberg (2006), p. 10.  A year after Linnaeus\\' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the rectory from the curate\\'s house.  Quammen (2007), p. 1. Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants. Blunt (2004), p. 15.  Early educationLinnaeus\\' father began teaching him Latin, religion, and geography at an early age; one account says that due to family use of Latin for conversation, the boy learned Latin before he learned Swedish. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local yeoman. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander \"was better calculated to extinguish a child\\'s talents than develop them.\" Blunt (2004), pp. 15–16.  Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Stöver (1974), p. 5.  Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus\\' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Växjö Gymnasium. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus\\' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. Blunt (2004), p. 16.  Stöver (1974), pp. 5–6.  At the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical litterature. He remarks in his journal ”read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh Månsson´s Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz´s Flora Åboensis, Palmberg´s Serta Florea Suecana,  Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis..”   Linnaeus entered the Växjö Gymnasium in 1724, where he studied mainly Greek, Hebrew, theology and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. Stöver (1974), p. 6.  Blunt (2004), pp. 16–17.  In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus\\' father visited to ask the professors how his son\\'s studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer. Blunt (2004), pp. 17–18.  Stöver (1974), pp. 8–11.  University LundRothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort\\'s system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant.  In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne. Blunt (2004), p. 18.  Stöver (1974), p. 13.  He was registered as  , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications. Professor Kilian Stobæus, natutral scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures. Blunt (2004), pp. 21–22.  Stöver (1974), p. 15.  In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students sharing the same interests. Stöver (1974), pp. 14–15.  Uppsala In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. Blunt (2004), pp. 23–25.  In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. Blunt (2004), pp. 31–32.  He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden. Stöver (1974), pp. 19–20. In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis,   on plant sexual reproduction. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. Blunt (2004), pp. 32–34.  In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius\\' house to Rudbeck\\'s to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions. Blunt (2004), p. 34–37.  Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort\\'s system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example,   and  . He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden,  . Blunt (2001), pp. 36–37. Rudbeck\\'s former assistant, Nils Rosén, returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus\\' botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a \"disagreement\" with Rudbeck\\'s wife and had to move out of his mentor\\'s house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.  Anderson (1997), p. 40.  Expedition to Lapland  During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus\\' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia\\'s vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. Anderson (1997), pp. 42–43.  Blunt (2001), p. 38. Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala in May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. Blunt (2001), pp. 42–43.  He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock Anderson (1997), pp. 43–44.  and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common animal in Lapland. Anderson (1997), p. 46. Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Umeå, Luleå and Tornio. He returned from his six-month long, over   expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Blunt (2001), pp. 63–65.  Blunt (2004), pp. 39–42.  Broberg (2006), p. 29.  Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book  . Quammen (2007), p. 2.  Stöver (1974), pp. 38–39. In   Linnaeus\\' ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora.  The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with   as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described   as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus\\'s works. Frodin (2001), p. 27. It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was traveling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\" Blunt (2001), p. 54.  DalarnaIn 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at Røros.  European excursions DoctorateBack in Uppsala, Linnaeus\\' relations with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg\\'s family. Sohlberg\\'s father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Blunt (2001), p. 74.  Sohland\\'s father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted. Blunt (2001), pp. 78–79. In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. Stöver (1974), p. 71.  On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor\\'s dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly. Anderson (1997), pp. 60–61.  Blunt (2004), p. 90.  When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk, he began working toward a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for awarding \"instant\" degrees after as little as a week.  First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. The next step was to take an oral examination and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28.  Blunt (2001), p. 94.  During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other\\'s work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete. Anderson (1997), p. 66.  Blunt (2004), pp. 98–100.  Publishing of  One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as  . Blunt (2001), p. 98.  Anderson (1997), pp. 62–63. Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, Herman Boerhaave, who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest\\'s knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his  . Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working:   and  . Blunt (2004), pp. 100–102.  George Clifford In August, during Linnaeus\\' stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus\\' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane\\'s Natural History of Jamaica, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted. Anderson (1997), p. 64.  Stöver (1974), pp. 81–82.  On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at Hartekamp, free to buy any book or plant he wanted.In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford\\'s expense. Blunt (2001), pp. 106–107.  He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his cabinet, Stöver (1974), p. 89.  as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in  . Miller was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus\\' system. Stöver (1974), pp. 89–90.  Linnaeus also traveled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. He failed, however, to make Dillenius publicly accept his new classification system. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants. Stöver (1974), pp. 90–93.  The next year, he published  , in which he described 935 genera of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with  , with another sixty (sexaginta) genera. Stöver (1974), p. 95. His work at Hartekamp led to another book,  , a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.  It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.  \"If this is not Helen\\'s Nepenthes, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator!\" (translated from Latin by Harry Veitch) Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again. Blunt (2001), p. 123.  Koerner (1999), p. 56.  Return to SwedenWhen Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.    Stöver (1974), p. 141.  Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. Stöver (1974), pp. 146–147.  Koerner (1999), p. 16.  During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; he became the first Praeses in the academy by drawing of lots. Koerner (1999), pp. 103–105. Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.  Stöver (1974), p. 382.  In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 49–50.  Further exploration of Sweden Öland and GotlandTen days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in  , written in Swedish. Like  , it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland. Koerner (1999), p. 115.  Blunt (2004), pp. 137–142. During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books:   and  .   was a strictly botanical book, while   was zoological.  Stöver (1974), pp. 117–118.  Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742. Celsius\\' scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0 °C and freezing point at 100 °C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard. Koerner (1999), p. 204.  VästergötlandIn the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book  , published the next year.  Blunt (2004), p. 159.  After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy. In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title archiater, or chief physician, by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick—a mark of great respect. Blunt (2004), p. 165.  The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Stöver (1974), p. 167.  ScaniaIn the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus\\' observations were published the next year in  . Blunt (2004), pp. 198–205.  Koerner (1999), p. 116.  Rector of Uppsala University In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.  Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his \"apostles\". Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 56–57.  His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala. Blunt (2004), pp. 173–174.  Publishing of  Linnaeus published   in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden. Blunt (2004), p. 221.  Publishing of  Linnaeus published  , the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. Stace (1991), p. 24.  The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August  of the same year.The date of issue of both volumes was later, for practical purposes, arbitrarily set on 1 May, see Stearn, W.T. (1957), The preparation of the Species Plantarum and the introduction of binomial nomenclature, in: Species Plantarum, A Facsimile of the first edition, London, Ray Society: 72 and ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 13.5: \"The two volumes of Linnaeus\\' Species plantarum, ed. 1 (1753), which appeared in May and August, 1753, respectively, are treated as having been published simultaneously on 1 May 1753.\"  The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 47.  Stöver (1974), pp. 198–199.  The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order. Blunt (2004), p. 166.  EnnoblementLinnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.  Blunt (2004), p. 219.  In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move. Blunt (2004), pp. 220–224. Since the initial release of   in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature, the equivalent of  .  Blunt (2004), p. 6. The Swedish king Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757, but he was not ennobled until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinized as  ), \\'Linné\\' being a shortened and gallicised version of \\'Linnæus\\', and the German title \\'von\\' signifying his ennoblement.  The noble family\\'s coat of arms prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus\\' favourite plants; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the center is an egg \"to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated in ovo.\" At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the Aeneid, which reads \" \": we extend our fame by our deeds. Blunt (2004), p. 199.  Blunt (2004), pp. 229–230.  Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 62. After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country. Uppsala University, Linné Online, English language version  He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, \"the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire\", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija, Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia).  Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected him and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia, the source of scopolamine, after him. Because of a great distance, they didn\\'t ever meet.   Last yearsLinnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.  He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.  Blunt (2004), p. 245. Linnaeus\\' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. Blunt (2004), p. 232.  He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognize himself as their author. Stöver (1974), pp. 243–245.  Broberg (2006), p. 42. In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.  Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 63.  Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was interred in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January. Quammen (2007), p. 4.  Anderson (1997), pp. 104–106. His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. However, in 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.  Blunt (2001), pp. 238–240. The von Linné name ended with his son Carl, who never married.  His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3.  There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters.  Apostles  During Linnaeus\\' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called \"apostles\". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. Blunt (2004), pp. 189–190.  To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus\\' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Broberg (2006), pp. 37–39.  Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. Anderson (1997), pp. 92–93.  The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus\\' new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Blunt (2004), pp. 184–185.  Many of the apostles died during their expeditions. Early expeditionsChristopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström\\'s widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Blunt (2004), pp. 185–186.  Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling. Two years after Tärnström\\'s expedition, Finnish-born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm. Anderson (1997), pp. 93–94.  Cook expeditions and Japan Daniel Solander was living in Linnaeus\\' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his oldest daughter\\'s hand in marriage. On Linnaeus\\' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Anderson (1997), p. 96.  Blunt (2004), pp. 191–192.  Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa. Blunt (2004), pp. 192–193. Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus\\' death. Blunt (2004), pp. 193–194.  Major publications  Systema Naturae The first edition of   was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work. Linnaeus (1735)  By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. In it, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as \" \", were supplemented with concise and now familiar \"binomials\", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, Physalis angulata. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier,  Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.     (or, more fully,  ) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today. In 1754, Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes (Genera Plantarum 5th edition). One, Cryptogamia, included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns). Van den Hoek et al. (2005).      was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition. Stace (1991), p. 22.      (1751) was a summary of Linnaeus\\' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in   (1736) and   (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his   and  : all were printed in Holland (as well as   (1737) and   (1735)), the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm.  Linnaean collectionsAt the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered as one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744-1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalized and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Wallin, L. 2001. Catalogue of type specimens. 4. Linnaean specimens. - pp. [1], 1-128. Uppsala. (Uppsala University, Museum of Evolution, Zoology Section). In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his countryhouse at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linné\\'s son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linné\\'s death his son confirmed that mice had caused \"horrible damage\" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage. Dance, S.P. 1967. Report on the Linnaean shell collection. - Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London 178 (1): 1-24, Pl. 1-10.  He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father\\'s later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material.In 1784 the botanist James Edward Smith purchased from the inheritants (the widow and daughter of Carl Linnaeus) nearly all of the Linnean private scientific effects and transferred them to London.  Not all material in Linné\\'s private collection was transported to England. 33 fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent away and were later lost.In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection, he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away.  Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material. Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika (1720-1782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as \"Museum Ludovicae Ulricae\" or \"M. L. U.\"). This collection was donated by his grandson King Gustav IV Adolf (1778-1837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik (1710-1771) (in the Linnean sources known as \"Museum Adolphi Friderici\" or \"Mus. Ad. Fr.\"), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.  Linnaean taxonomy The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus\\' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature. Reveal & Pringle (1993), p. 160-161.  During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences.The Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy, starting with three kingdoms. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (singular: genus), which were divided into Species (singular: species).  Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology.  Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus that was not present in Linnaeus\\' original system. Davis & Heywood (1973), p. 17. Linnaeus\\' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not simply upon differences.  Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.   While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid \"observable characteristics\" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, DNA sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus\\' time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships), the fundamental principle remains sound. Views on mankindAccording to German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the question of man\\'s origin began with Linnaeus. He helped future research in the natural history of man by describing humans just as he described any other plant or animal. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 156–157.  He was the first person to place humans in a system of biological classification .   AnthropomorphaLinnaeus classified humans among the primates (as they were later called) beginning with the first edition of  . During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 173–174.  He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 170.  Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 167, quotes Linnaeus explaining the real difference would necessarily be absent from his classification system, as it was not a morphological characteristic: \"I well know what a splendidly great difference there is [between] a man and a bestia [literally, \"beast\"; that is, a non-human animal] when I look at them from a point of view of morality. Man is the animal which the Creator has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent mind and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life\". See also books.google.com in which Linnaeus cites the significant capacity to reason as the distinguishing characteristic of humans.  Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, Anthropomorpha, meaning \"manlike.\" Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 167.  This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk Wallerius, Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe a human as \\'like a man\\'.  In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied:    It does not please [you] that I\\'ve placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term \\'with human form\\', \"antropomorphon\"    but man learns to know himself. Let\\'s not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History. Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in the first edition of his Manual of Natural History (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the Quadrumana (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and Bimana (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably Georges Cuvier. Some elevated the distinction to the level of order. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates – and especially the great apes – made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. Charles Darwin wrote, in The Descent of Man in 1871:    The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.   I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline. The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God  (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 171–172.  The conflict between world views based on science and theology that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of   introduced new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 175.  as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens. Blunt (2004), p. 8.  The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature, not be a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 191–192.  In his book  , he said, \"One should not vent one\\'s wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere \\'aoutomata mechanica,\\' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.\" Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 166.    Strange people in distant landsLinnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in   based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication: Homo troglodytes (\"caveman\")  Bontius (1658), p. 84.  and published a third in 1771: Homo lar.  Swedish historian Gunnar Broberg states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 187. In early editions of  , many well-known legendary creatures were included such as the phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, Linnaeus is translated, writing that the satyrus is \"hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen.\" which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 176–177.  Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays.  For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, but they did not find any signs of its existence. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 186.  Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.    Four races In the first edition of  , Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties based on continent and skin colour: \"Europæus albus\" (white European), \"Americanus rubescens\" (red American), \"Asiaticus fuscus\" (brown Asian) and \"Africanus niger\" (black African). In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed stereotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity, and changed the description of Asians\\' skin tone to \"luridus\" (yellow).      Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon \"monstrosus\" for \"wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people\".  Commemoration  Anniversaries of Linnaeus\\' birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations. Östholm (2007)  Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes.  There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Parliament of Sweden, Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University.  Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, the crater Linné on the Earth\\'s moon and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite. Commentary on LinnaeusAndrew Dickson White wrote in   (1896):   Linnaeus... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking. ...Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works. ...warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.

Congo was settled in the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. by Bantus from present-day Nigeria. During its history the area has also been known as Congo, Congo Free State, Belgian Congo and Zaire. The Kingdom of Kongo was a powerful kingdom that existed from the 14th to the 18th century. It was the dominant force in the region until the arrival of the Portuguese. Second in importance was the Anziku Kingdom. Belgian colonization Congo Free State (1885–1908)  The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association Internationale Africaine, a non-governmental organization. Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman. The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under Leopold II\\'s administration, the Congo Free State became the site of one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century. The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903, including one Belgian national for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives. Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. In the absence of a census, the first was made in 1924, it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Roger Casement\\'s famous 1904 report estimated ten million people. According to Casement\\'s report, indiscriminate \"war\", starvation, reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country\\'s depopulation.  The European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900. By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony.  Belgian Congo (1908–1960)  On 15 November 1908 King Léopold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State. The renamed Belgian Congo came under the administration of the Belgian parliament, which lasted until independence was granted in 1960. The Belgian administration might be most charitably characterized as paternalistic colonialism. Roman Catholic and Protestant churches dominated the education system and the curricula reflected Christian and Western values. In 1948 Christian missions controlled 99.6% of educational facilities. They had little regard for native culture and beliefs. Native schools provided a mainly religious and vocational education.  The Congo Crisis (1960–1965)  Following riots in Leopoldville between 4–7 January 1959, and Stanleyville on 31 October 1959, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence. The Belgians and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960. At the end of the Conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960, and full independence granted on 30 June 1960. The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960, adopting the name \"Republic of the Congo\" (République du Congo).  As the French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon receiving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as Congo-Léopoldville and Congo-Brazzaville, after their capital cities. President Mobutu changed the country\\'s official name to Zaire in 1966. In 1960, the country was in a very unstable state—regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government—and with the departure of the Belgian administrators, there were almost no skilled bureaucrats left in the country. The first Congolese university graduate was only in 1956, and virtually no one in the new nation had any idea of how to manage a country of such size.Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo.Even from this fleeting moment of independence democracy began to unravel. On 5 July 1960 a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country, Katanga, seceded under Moise Tshombe. The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this same period Congo\\'s second richest province, Kasai, also announced its independence on 8 August 1960.Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance. Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. On 14 September 1960, with U.S. and CIA support, Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba. On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to Élisabethville (now Lubumbashi), capital of Katanga. In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches. For the next three weeks, he was not seen or heard from. Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by some villagers. In fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival. It was soon clear that he had been murdered in custody. In 2001, a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers, under Katangan command. Lumumba was beaten, placed in front of a firing squad with 2 other allies, cut up, buried, dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid. In Stanleyville, those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under Antoine Gizenga which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961. After some reverses, UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of South Kasai on 30 December 1961, and Katanga on 15 January 1963.A new crisis erupted in the Simba Rebellion of 1964-1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels. European mercenaries, US, and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion. Zaire (1965–1996)  Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Mobutu, by then commander in chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years. Mobutu quickly consolidated his power and was elected unopposed as president in 1970. Embarking on a campaign of cultural awareness, Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire and required citizens to adopt African names. Relative peace and stability prevailed until 1977 and 1978 when Katangan rebels, based in Angola, launched a series of invasions (Shaba I and II) into the Shaba (Katanga) region. The rebels were driven out with the aid of Belgian paratroopers.Zaire remained a one-party state in the 1980s. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS), were active. Mobutu\\'s attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism. As the Cold War came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime\\'s human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his massive embezzlement of government funds for personal use. In April 1990, Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of a reform package were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting Kinshasa to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on U.S. Air Force planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa. In 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised Sovereign National Conference was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo as its chairman, along with Étienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next two years, they never took place.  First Congo War (1996–1997)  By 1996, tensions from the neighboring Rwanda war and genocide had spilled over to Zaire: see History of Rwanda. Rwandan Hutu militia forces (Interahamwe), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a Tutsi-led government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate its massacres in November 1996, the Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu. The Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, became known as the Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. They were soon joined by various Zairean politicians, who had been unsuccessfully opposing the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years, and now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region\\'s strongest military forces. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country, and Kabila marched unopposed to Kinshasa on 20 May. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Second Congo War (1998–2003)  Kabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country, and lost his allies. To counterbalance the power and influence of Rwanda in DRC, the Ugandan troops instigated the creation of another rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. They attacked in August 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Soon afterwards, Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe became involved militarily in the Congo, with Angola and Zimbabwe supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. However, Kabila was assassinated in 2001 by one of his bodyguards and was succeeded by his son, Joseph. Upon taking office, Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. Kabila partly succeeded when a further peace deal was brokered between him, Uganda, and Rwanda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops.Currently, the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a   wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country, including diamonds, copper, zinc, and coltan. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders, held in Sun City, lasted a full six weeks, beginning in April 2002. In June, they signed a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003, all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. Few people in the Congo  have been unaffected by the armed conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some way–either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict. The response of the international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic efforts to end the war has been relatively consistent, but it has taken no effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo. United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war unleashed on the local population. But they had shown little will to tackle the responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place. Hence Rwanda, like Uganda, has escaped any significant sanction for its role.  Transitional government (2003–2006)  DR Congo had a transitional government in July 2003 until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its first multi-party elections since independence in 1960. After this Joseph Kabila took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parts from  20–22 August 2006 in the streets of the capital, Kinshasa. Sixteen people died before policemen and UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote. Bemba has publicly commented on election \"irregularities,\" despite the fact that every neutral observer has praised the elections. On 6 December 2006 the Transitional Government came to an end as Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President. Continued conflictsThe fragility of the state has allowed continued violence and human rights abuses in the east. There are three significant centers of conflict.Ituri, where MONUC has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the Ituri conflictNorthern Katanga, where Mai-Mai created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa.In October 2009 a new conflict started in Dongo, Sud-Ubangi District where clashes had broken out over access to fishing ponds. Kivu conflict  North Kivu and South Kivu, where Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the Banyamulenge, Rwanda supported RCD-Goma rebels (see Kivu war).In April 2012, ethnic Tutsi soldiers mutinied against the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mutineers formed a rebel group called the March 23 Movement (M23), composed of former members of the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP). On 20 November 2012, M23 took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of one million people.  Re-election of Joseph KabilaOn December 2011, Joseph Kabila was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi, where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate Etienne Tshisekedi.  Official observers from the Carter Center reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility.   On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to \"swear himself in\" as president.

Sweeney, p.1  It concludes a series of books running from Joshua through Judges and Samuel, which make up the section of the Hebrew Bible called the Former Prophets. This series is also often referred to as the Deuteronomistic history, a body of writing which scholars believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the Jewish kingdom by Babylon in 586\\xa0BCE and a foundation for a return from exile.  Contents See 1 Kings and 2 Kings at Bible GatewayDavid dies and Solomon comes to the throne. At the beginning of his reign he assumes God\\'s promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people.  The centrepiece of Solomon\\'s reign is the building of the First Temple: the claim that this took place 480 years after the Exodus from Egypt marks it as a key event in Israel\\'s history.  At the end, however, he follows other gods and oppresses Israel. As a consequence of Solomon\\'s failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than Yahweh, the kingdom of David is split in two in the reign of his own son Rehoboam, who becomes the first to reign over the kingdom of Judah.  The kings who follow Rehoboam in Jerusalem continue the royal line of David (i.e., they inherit the promise to David); in the north, however, dynasties follow each other in rapid succession, and the kings are uniformly bad (meaning that they fail to follow Yahweh alone). At length God brings the Assyrians to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise.Hezekiah, the 14th king of Judah \"did what was right in the eyes of the Lord\" and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods. Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria. But Manasseh, the next king, reverses the reforms,  and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king. Mannasah\\'s righteous grandson Josiah reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess Huldah, affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed. God brings the Babylonians against Jerusalem; Yahweh deserts his people, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity. (The final verses record how Jehoiachin, the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon). Composition Textual historyIn the original Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by Jews) First and Second Kings were a single book, as were First and Second Samuel. When this was translated into Greek in the last few centuries BCE, Kings was joined with Samuel in a four-part work called the Book of Kingdoms. The Greek Orthodox branch of Christianity continues to use the Greek translation (the Septuagint), but when a Latin translation (called the Vulgate) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually both Kings and Samuel were separated into two books each.  The Deuteronomistic historyAccording to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was Jeremiah, whose life overlapped the fall of Jerusalem in 586\\xa0BCE.  The most common view today accepts Martin Noth\\'s thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the Book of Deuteronomy, and which biblical scholars therefore call the Deuteronomistic history.  Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers,  a first edition from the time of Josiah (late 7th century), promoting Josiah\\'s religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from  the mid 6th century. Fretheim, p.7  Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century edition pointing to Hezekiah of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century version with a similar message but identifying Jehu of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.  SourcesThe editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a \"Book of the Acts of Solomon\" and, frequently, the \"Annals of the Kings of Judah\" and a separate book, \"Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\". The \"Deuteronomic\" perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon\\'s speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example.  The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda,  but in the broadest sense they appear to have been: 1 Kings 1-2: The end of the \"court history of David\" (also called the Succession Narrative), which also constitutes most of 2 Samuel 9-20. For the rest of Solomon\\'s reign the text names its source as \"the book of the acts of Solomon\", but other sources were employed, and much was added by the redactor. Israel and Judah: The two \"chronicles\" of Israel and Judah provided the chronological framework, but few details apart from the succession of monarchs and the account of how the Temple of Solomon was progressively stripped as true religion declined. A third source, or set of sources, were cycles of stories about various prophets (Elijah and Elisha, Isaiah, Ahijah and Micaiah), plus a few smaller miscellaneous traditions. The conclusion of the book (2 Kings 25:18-21, 27-30) was probably based on personal knowledge. A few sections were editorial additions not based on sources. These include various predictions of the downfall of the northern kingdom, the equivalent prediction of the downfall of Judah following the reign of Manasseh, the extension of Josiah\\'s reforms in accordance with the laws of Deuteronomy, and the revision of the narrative from Jeremiah concerning Judah\\'s last days.  Themes and genreKings is \"history-like,\" but it mixes legends, folktales, miracle stories and fiction in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God\\'s offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history.  The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the temple in Jerusalem (none do, and therefore all are \"evil\"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the \"high places\" (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to  important and successful kings like Omri and Jeroboam II and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel\\'s history, the battle of Qarqar.  The major themes of Kings are God\\'s promise, the recurrent apostasy of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel:  Promise: In return for Israel\\'s promise to worship Yahweh alone, Yahweh makes promises to David and to Israel - to David, the promise that his line will rule Israel forever, to Israel, the promise of the land they will possess. Apostasy: the great tragedy of Israel\\'s history, meaning the destruction of the kingdom and the Temple, is due to the failure of the people, but more especially the kings, to worship Yahweh alone (Yahweh being the god of Israel). Judgement: Apostasy leads to judgement. Judgement is not punishment, but simply the natural (or rather, God-ordained) consequence of Israel\\'s failure to worship Yahweh alone. Another and related theme is that of prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God\\'s prophecies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.  Textual features ChronologyThe standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology.  To take just a single example, Omri\\'s accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of Asa of Judah (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor Zimri in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15).  The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version.  A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none have achieved consensus status.  Kings and 2 Chronicles2 Chronicles covers much the same time-period as Kings, but it ignores the northern kingdom of Israel almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, Hezekiah is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and Manasseh is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign. Sutherland, p.247  It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and re-wrote history as he would have liked it to have been.

Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, the film stars Michael Keaton in the title role, as well as Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance. The film, in which Batman deals with the rise of a costumed criminal known as \"The Joker\" (Nicholson), was the first installment of Warner Bros.\\' initial Batman film series.After Burton was hired as director, Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton\\'s Beetlejuice (1988). Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman. Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the box office profits, and his shooting schedule.Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out. Uncredited rewrites were performed by Warren Skaaren, Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems. Batman was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. The film received several Saturn Award nominations and a Golden Globe nomination, and won an Academy Award. It was also inspired the equally successful Batman: The Animated Series, paving the way for the DC animated universe, and has influenced Hollywood\\'s modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre.The film marked the beginning of a Batman film series, with three sequels Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997) released, the latter two were directed by Joel Schumacher  instead of Burton. The film series was rebooted in 2005 with Batman Begins, directed by Christopher Nolan. PlotAs a child, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) witnesses his parents killed by a criminal. He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime in the guise of Batman while concealing his secret identity, adopting the public face of a billionaire playboy and head of Wayne Enterprises. Years later, Gotham City is controlled by crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Despite the best efforts of newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and police commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle), the Gotham City Police Department remains corrupt. Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) begin investigating the rumors of a shadowy vigilante figure dressed as a bat who has been fighting criminals throughout the city.Vicki and Knox attend a benefit at Wayne Manor, where Bruce is taken by Vicki\\'s charms and spends the night with her. That same night, Grissom\\'s second in command, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. After the police receive a tip-off and arrive to arrest him, Napier realizes he has been set up by his boss as revenge for his affair with Grissom\\'s mistress. In the midst of the shoot-out, Batman arrives and takes out Napier\\'s henchmen. In the ensuing struggle, Napier shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with his metal-reinforced gauntlet and sends it back in Napier\\'s face, tearing it open. Reeling from the pain, Napier topples over a platform rail and falls into a vat of chemicals, even as Batman tries to save him. The chemicals and a botched attempt at plastic surgery leave him with chalk white skin, red lips, green hair, and a permanent rictal grin. Driven insane by his reflection, he reinvents himself as \"the Joker\", a master criminal and \"homicidal artist\".After killing Grissom, the Joker takes over his empire and holds the city at his mercy by chemically altering everyday hygiene products, causing those using a certain combination of products to laugh to death. Batman attempts to track down the Joker, who has become obsessed with Vicki. During an encounter with the Joker, Batman recognizes him as the criminal who murdered his parents. Bruce\\'s butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough), lets Vicki into the Batcave, where she tells Bruce she is in love with him. Bruce promises to pursue a relationship with her after he has defeated the Joker. Batman destroys the factory the Joker used to make the poisoned products and creates an antidote. The Joker holds a parade through Gotham, luring its citizens on to its streets by dispensing money, intending to kill them with lethal gas. Batman foils his plan, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral church. After a fight with Batman, the Joker tries to escape on a helicopter, but Batman uses a grappling hook to snare the Joker\\'s legs to a gargoyle; the Joker falls to his death when the gargoyle breaks loose of its moorings. Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Cast Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier/The Joker Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth Tracey Walter as Bob Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent Jack Palance as Carl Grissom Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt Production Development   After the financial success of Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct Batman. Burton had then-girlfriend Julie Hickson write a new 30-page film treatment, feeling the previous script by Tom Mankiewicz was campy. The success of The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke rekindled Warner Bros.\\' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke.  Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Steve Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986.    It included the Joker and Rupert Thorne as the main villains, with a cameo appearance by the Penguin. Silver St. Cloud and Dick Grayson were key supporting roles. It followed the similar storyline from Englehart\\'s own Strange Apparitions (ISBN 1-56389-500-5). Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986. Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay.    Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that \"unlocking the mystery\" would become part of the storyline.    He reasoned, \"You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.\"    Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character.  One scene in Hamm\\'s script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne\\'s parents. When Hamm\\'s script was rewritten, the scene was deleted but retaken to Batman Begins. Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm\\'s script, which Batman co-creator Bob Kane greeted with positive feedback.  Hamm\\'s script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the United States.  Batman was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton\\'s Beetlejuice (1988).  When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in. Hamm explained, \"they hear Tim Burton\\'s name and they think of Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure. They hear Keaton\\'s name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn\\'t believe us.\"  To combat negative reports on the film\\'s production, Batman co-creator Bob Kane was hired as creative consultant.    CastingParallel to the Superman casting, a who\\'s who of Hollywood top stars were considered for the role of Batman, with the likes of Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Selleck and Bill Murray being considered.     Tim Burton was pressured to cast an obvious action movie star.  Producer Jon Peters favored Keaton, arguing he had the right \"edgy, tormented quality.\" Having directed Keaton in Beetlejuice, Burton agreed. Keaton\\'s casting caused a controversy among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Tim Burton, Sam Hamm, Mark Canton, Michael Keaton, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Gathering Storm, 2005, Warner Home Video  Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting.  Burton acknowledged, \"Obviously there was a negative response from the comic book people. I think they thought we were going to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that.\"    Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration. Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, David Bowie and James Woods were considered for the Joker.     Robin Williams lobbied hard for the part.  Jack Nicholson had been producer Michael Uslan\\'s and Bob Kane\\'s choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of The Witches of Eastwick.  Nicholson had what was known as an \"off-the-clock\" agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming,  as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games.    Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days.  He received a $6 million salary, as well as a large percentage of the box office gross. The fee is reported to be as high as $60 million. Sean Young was originally cast as Vicki Vale, but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight, \"Part 2: The Gathering Storm\", DVD documentary, 2005  Burton suggested replacing Young with Michelle Pfeiffer but Keaton, who was in a relationship with Pfeiffer, believed it would be too awkward. She went on to portray Catwoman in Batman Returns. Young\\'s departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: she was able to join the production immediately and was cast.   As a fan of Michael Gough\\'s work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne\\'s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Tim Burton, DVD audio commentary, 2005, Warner Home Video  Robert Wuhl was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character was originally supposed to die by the Joker\\'s poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers \"liked [my] character so much,\" Wuhl said \"that they decided to let me live.\" Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, Batman: The Heroes, 2005, Warner Home Video  Tim Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept,  but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for Batman Forever, which disappointed Williams.  Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast Tracey Walter as the Joker\\'s henchman, Bob; in real life, Nicholson and Walter are close friends.  Kiefer Sutherland was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script.  The rest of the cast included Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom. Filming The filmmakers considered filming Batman entirely on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at Pinewood Studios in England from October 1988 to January 1989.  18 sound stages were used, almost the entirety of Pinewood\\'s 95-acre backlot.  Locations included Knebworth House and Hatfield House doubling for Wayne Manor, plus Acton Lane Power Station and Little Barford Power Station.  Hanke, p.87-96  The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million.  Filming was highly secretive. The unit publicist was offered and refused £10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes\\' worth) were stolen.    With various problems during filming, Burton called it \"torture. The worst period of my life!\" Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.  Jonathan Gems, Warren Skaaren and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming.  Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros.  Burton explained, \"I don\\'t understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work.\"  Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot.  Bob Kane supported this decision. Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a   model of the cathedral.  This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: \"Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, \\'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?\\' \\'We\\'ll talk about it when you get to the top!\\' I had to tell him that I didn\\'t know.\"    Design  Burton was impressed with Anton Furst\\'s designs in The Company of Wolves, and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for Beetlejuice.  Furst had been too committed on High Spirits, a choice he later regretted.  Furst enjoyed working with Burton. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever felt so naturally in tune with a director\", he said; \"Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.\"  Furst and the art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to \"make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable.\"  Furst continued, \"we imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going\\'\".  The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film\\'s production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference.  Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile,  adding two Browning machine guns.  On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, \"We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s\".  The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed. Costume designer Bob Ringwood turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because \"the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build\", he stated. \"The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.\"    Burton commented, \"Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage\".  Burton\\'s idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit.  Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000.  Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit.  Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.  Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson\\'s chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson\\'s contract was approval over the makeup designer.  Music  Burton hired Danny Elfman, his collaborator on Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, to compose the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. Danny Elfman, Tim Burton, Nocturnal Overtures: The Music of Batman, 2005, Warner Home Video  In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number.  Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson\\'s songs together for the entire film score. Burton protested the ideas, citing \"my movies aren\\'t commercial like Top Gun.\"  Elfman enlisted the help of Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek and Shirley Walker to arrange the compositions for the orchestra.  Elfman was later displeased with the audio mixing of his film score. \"Batman was done in England by technicians who didn\\'t care, and the non-caring showed,\" he stated. \"I\\'m not putting down England because they\\'ve done gorgeous dubs there, but this particular crew elected not to.\"  Batman was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman\\'s score. Both were successful,  and compilations of Elfman\\'s opening credits were used in the title sequence theme for Batman: The Animated Series, also composed by Shirley Walker.  Themes When discussing the central theme of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, \"the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It\\'s a fight between two disturbed people\", adding that \"The Joker is such a great character because there\\'s a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you\\'re not bound by the laws of society\".   Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world.  Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an antihero. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker.  Kim Newman theorized that \"Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent\". A visual motif is present in the scene of Batman\\'s first major act of vigilantism at Axis Chemicals, wherein he is carefully framed so that the single word AXIS, in gigantic red neon letters, looms over him, comparing his acts to those of the totalitarian governments of World War II and thus implying that the dangers of these actions include the transformation of Jack Napier into the Joker.    Batman also conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design.    Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham\\'s design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). \"Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot\", he continued, \"is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, staring down at the citizens.\"  Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that \"The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939\"; but later said: \"Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir.\" Hanke, p.87-96  Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo.  MarketingProduction designer Anton Furst designed the poster, which he called \"evocative but ubiquitous. Only featuring the Bat-Symbol. Not too much and not too little.\" Earlier designs \"had the word \\'Batman\\' spelled in RoboCop or Conan the Barbarian-type font.\"  Jon Peters unified all the film\\'s tie-ins, even turning down $6 million from General Motors to build the Batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control. During production, Peters read in The Wall Street Journal that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but happened to create enormous anticipation for the film.  DC Comics allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own comic book miniseries. Hamm\\'s stories were collected in the graphic novel Batman: Blind Justice (ISBN 978-1563890475). Denys Cowan and Dick Giordano illustrated the artwork.  Blind Justice tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to Wayne Enterprises. It also marks the first appearance of Henri Ducard, who was later used in the rebooted Batman Begins, albeit as an alias for the more notable Ra\\'s al Ghul. In the months pre-dating Batman s release in June 1989, a popular culture phenomenon rose known as \"Batmania\".    Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold.  Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered, \"That summer was huge. You couldn\\'t turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot.\"  Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner.  It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989.  Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed \"it is less movie than a corporate behemoth.\"    Reception Box officeBatman opened on June 23, 1989, grossing $43.6 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend record, set by Ghostbusters II one week earlier, with $29.4 million.  Batman would eventually gross $251.2 million in North America and $160.15 million internationally, totaling $411.35 million.  Batman was the first film to earn $100 million in its first ten days of release,  and was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book until 2008\\'s The Dark Knight.  The film\\'s gross is the 66th highest ever in North American ranks.  Although Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade made the most money worldwide in 1989,  Batman was able to beat The Last Crusade in North America,  and made a further $150 million in home video sales. Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). \"Three Go Mad in Gotham\", Empire, pp. 44-52. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.  Critical reactionBatman was criticized in some quarters for being \"too dark\".  Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker than Batman in terms of characterization and screentime.  Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm, who is a comic book fan, said it was Burton\\'s idea to have the Joker murder Wayne\\'s parents. \"The Writer\\'s Strike was going on,\" Hamm said, \"and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred\\'s last day of employment at Wayne Manor.\" Tim Burton, Sam Hamm, Danny Elfman, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Legend Reborn, 2005, Warner Home Video The songs written by Prince were criticized for being \"too out of place\".  While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.  On the film, Burton remarked, \"I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It\\'s OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.\"  Based on 57 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of reviewers have enjoyed Batman.  By comparison, Metacritic has collected an average score of 66, based on 17 reviews. Burton biographer Alison McMahan wrote, \"fans of the Batman franchise complained when they heard of Michael Keaton\\'s casting. However, no one complained when they saw his performance.\"  James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, \"the best thing that can be said about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort.\"  Variety felt \"Jack Nicholson stole every scene\" but still greeted the film with positive feedback.  Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed \"Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can\\'t care much about.\" He also called the film \"a depressing experience\".  His reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a \\'refreshingly adult\\' approach with performances, direction and set design that \\'draws you into a psychological world\\'. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called it \"watchable enough\".  LegacyAnton Furst and Peter Young won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction,  while Nicholson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy).  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated Batman in six categories (Production Design, Visual Effects, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound and Actor in a Supporting Role for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories.  Nicholson, Basinger, the make-up department and costume designer Bob Ringwood all received nominations at the Saturn Awards. The film was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film  and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The success of Batman prompted Warner Bros. Animation to create the acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series, as a result beginning the long-running DC animated universe  and helped establish the modern day superhero film genre. Series co-creator Bruce Timm stated the television show\\'s Art Deco design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, \"our show would never have gotten made if it hadn\\'t been for that first Batman movie.\"  Batman initiated the original Batman film series. Burton joked, \"ever since I did Batman, it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I\\'m the one responsible for that trend.\" Producers Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker filed a breach of contract lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be \"the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of Batman and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of Batman.\"  A superior court judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of Batman have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have \"not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless.\"  Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker\\'s attorney as \"two popcorns and two Cokes\". Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that Batman has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film\\'s debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.

    "document_1_ld_output = {3189: 'Ascending chain condition The ascending chain condition (ACC) and descending chain condition (DCC) are finiteness properties satisfied by some algebraic structures, most importantly, ideals in certain commutative rings.    These conditions played an important role in the development of the structure theory of commutative rings in the works of David Hilbert, Emmy Noether, and Emil Artin. The conditions themselves can be stated in an abstract form, so that they make sense for any partially ordered set. This point of view is useful in abstract algebraic dimension theory due to Gabriel and Rentschler. DefinitionA partially ordered set (poset) P is said to satisfy the ascending chain condition (ACC) if every strictly ascending sequence of elements eventually terminates.  Equivalently, given any sequence  a_1 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_2 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_3 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, \\\\cdots,  there exists a positive integer n such that  a_n = a_{n+1} = a_{n+2} = \\\\cdots.  Similarly, P is said to satisfy the descending chain condition (DCC) if every strictly descending sequence of elements eventually terminates, that is, there is no infinite descending chain. Equivalently every descending sequence  \\\\cdots \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_3 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_2 \\\\,\\\\leq\\\\, a_1  of elements of P, eventually stabilizes. Comments A subtly different and stronger condition than \"containing no infinite ascending/descending chains\" is \"contains no arbitrarily long ascending/descending chains (optionally, \\'based at a given element\\')\". For instance, the disjoint union of the posets {0}, {0,1}, {0,1,2}, etc., satisfies both the ACC and the DCC, but has arbitrarily long chains. If one further identifies the 0 in all of these sets, then every chain is finite, but there are arbitrarily long chains based at 0. The descending chain condition on P is equivalent to P being well-founded: every nonempty subset of P has a minimal element (also called the minimal condition). Similarly, the ascending chain condition is equivalent to P being converse well-founded: every nonempty subset of P has a maximal element (the maximal condition). Every finite poset satisfies both ACC and DCC. A totally ordered set that satisfies the descending chain condition is called a well-ordered set.

Being the mainstream continuity of the franchise, it began publication in 1963 as a monthly periodical and was published continuously until it was relaunched with a new numbering order in 1999. In 2003 the series reverted to the numbering order of the first volume. The title has occasionally been published biweekly, and was published three times a month from 2008 to 2010. A film named after the comic was released July 3, 2012.After DC Comics\\' relaunch of Action Comics and Detective Comics with new #1 issues in 2011, it had been the highest-numbered American comic still in circulation until it was cancelled. The title ended its 50-year run as a continuously published comic with issue #700 in December 2012. It was replaced by The Superior Spider-Man as part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch of Marvel\\'s comic lines.    Publication history The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and artist and co-plotter Steve Ditko, and the pair produced 38 issues from 1962 to 1966. Ditko left after the 38th issue, while Lee remained as writer until issue 100. Since then, many writers and artists have taken over the monthly comic through the years, chronicling the adventures of Marvel\\'s most identifiable hero.The Amazing Spider-Man has been the character\\'s flagship series for his first fifty years in publication, and was the only monthly series to star Spider-Man until Peter Parker, The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1976 (although 1972 saw the debut of Marvel Team-Up, with the vast majority of issues featuring Spider-Man along with a rotating cast of other Marvel characters). Most of the major characters and villains of the Spider-Man saga have been introduced in Amazing, and with few exceptions, it is where most key events in the character\\'s history have occurred. The title was published continuously until #441 (Nov. 1998) when Marvel Comics relaunched it as vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999), but on Spider-Man\\'s 40th anniversary, this new title reverted to using the numbering of the original series, beginning again with issue #500 (Dec. 2003) and lasting until the final issue, #700 (Dec. 2012). Vol. 1  Vol. 2  Years   1-49       1963-1967   50-99      1967-1971   100-149    1971-1975   150-199    1975-1979   200-249    1980-1984   250-299    1984-1988   300-349    1988-1991   350-399    1991-1995   401-441    1995-1998   (442-499)  1-58  1999-2003    500-549  2003-2008    550-599  2008-2009    600-649  2009-2011    650-700  2011-2012   The 1960sThe initial years of the book, under Lee and Ditko, chronicled Spider-Man\\'s nascent career with his civilian life as hard-luck yet perpetually good-humored teenager Peter Parker. Peter balanced his career as Spider-Man with his job as a freelance photographer for The Daily Bugle (under the bombastic editor-publisher J. Jonah Jameson) to help support himself and his frail Aunt May. At the same time, Peter dealt with public hostility towards Spider-Man and the antagonism of his classmates Flash Thompson and Liz Allan at Midtown High School, while also embarking on a tentative, ill-fated romance with Jameson\\'s secretary, Betty Brant.By focusing on Parker\\'s everyday problems, Lee and Ditko created a groundbreakingly flawed, self-doubting superhero, and the first major teenaged superhero to be a protagonist and not a sidekick. Ditko\\'s quirky art provided a stark contrast to the more cleanly dynamic stylings of Marvel\\'s most prominent artist, Jack Kirby, and Ditko\\'s Spider-Man, slightly sinister yet affectionately cartoony,  combined with the humor and pathos of Lee\\'s writing to lay the foundation for what became an enduring mythos.Most of Spider-Man\\'s key villains and supporting characters were introduced during this time. Issue #1 (March 1963) featured the first appearances of J. Jonah Jameson and his astronaut son John Jameson, and the supervillain the Chameleon. It also included the hero\\'s first encounter with the superhero team The Fantastic Four. Issue #2 (May 1963) featured the first appearance of The Vulture and the beginning of Parker\\'s freelance photography career at the newspaper The Daily Bugle. The Lee-Ditko era continued to usher in a significant number of villains and supporting characters, including Doctor Octopus in #3 (July 1963); the Sandman and Betty Brant in #4 (Sept. 1963); the Lizard in #6 (Nov. 1963); Electro in #9 (March 1964); Mysterio in #13 (June 1964); the Green Goblin in #14 (July 1964); Kraven The Hunter in #15 (Aug. 1964); reporter Ned Leeds in #18 (Nov. 1964); the Scorpion in #20 (Jan. 1965); and the Molten Man in #28 (Sept. 1965) (that also featured Parker\\'s graduation from high school Peter began attending Empire State University in #31 (Dec. 1965), the issue which also featured the first appearances of friends and classmates Gwen Stacy and Harry Osborn. Harry\\'s father, Norman Osborn first appeared in #23 (April 1965) as a member of Jameson\\'s country club but is not named nor revealed as Harry\\'s father until #37 (June 1966). Probably the most celebrated issue of the Lee-Ditko run  is #33 (Feb. 1966), the third part of the story arc \"If This Be My Destiny\", and featuring the dramatic scene of Spider-Man, through force of will and thoughts of family, escaping from being pinned by heavy machinery. Although credited only as artist for most of his run, Ditko would eventually plot the stories as well as draw them, leaving Lee to script the dialogue. However, a rift between Ditko and Lee developed, and the two men were not on speaking terms long before Ditko completed his last issue, The Amazing Spider-Man  (July 1966). The exact reasons for the Ditko-Lee split have been a source of controversy  ever since. Spider-Man successor artist John Romita Sr., in a 2010 deposition, recalled that Lee and Ditko \"ended up not being able to work together because they disagreed on almost everything, cultural, social, historically, everything, they disagreed on characters...\" In successor penciler John Romita\\'s first issue, #39 (Aug. 1966), archnemesis the Green Goblin discovers Spider-Man\\'s secret identity and reveals his own to the captive hero. Romita\\'s Spider-Man – more polished and heroic-looking than Ditko\\'s – became the model for two decades. The Lee-Romita era saw the introduction of such characters as Daily Bugle managing editor Robbie Robertson in #52 (Sept. 1967) and NYPD Captain George Stacy, father of Parker\\'s girlfriend Gwen Stacy, in #56 (Jan. 1968). The most important supporting character to be introduced during the Romita era was Mary Jane Watson, who made her first full appearance in #42, (Nov. 1966), although she first appeared in #25 (June 1965) with her face obscured and had been mentioned since #15 (Aug. 1964).Lee and Romita toned down the prevalent sense of antagonism in Parker\\'s world by improving Parker\\'s relationship with the supporting characters and having stories focused as much on the social and college lives of the characters as they did on Spider-Man\\'s adventures. The stories also became more topical, addressing issues such as civil rights, racism, prisoners\\' rights, the Vietnam War, and political elections.Issue #50 (June 1967) introduced the highly enduring criminal mastermind the Kingpin, who would become a major force as well in the superhero series Daredevil. Other notable first appearances in the Lee-Romita era include the Rhino in #41 (Oct. 1966), the Shocker in #46 (March 1967), the Prowler in #78 (Nov. 1969), and the Kingpin\\'s son, Richard Fisk, in #83 (April 1970). The 1970s  Two spin-off series debuted in the 1970s: Marvel Team-Up in 1972, and The Spectacular Spider-Man in 1976. The flagship title\\'s second decade took a grim turn with a story in #89-90 (Oct.-Nov. 1970) featuring the death of Captain George Stacy. This was also the first Spider-Man story to be penciled by Gil Kane, who would alternate drawing duties with Romita for the next year-and-a-half and would draw several landmark issues.One such story took place in the controversial issues #96-98 (May–July 1971). Writer-editor Lee defied the Comics Code Authority with this story, in which Parker\\'s friend Harry Osborn, was hospitalized after tripping on LSD. Lee wrote this story upon a request from the US Department of Health, Education and Welfare for a story about the dangers of drugs. Citing its dictum against depicting drug use, even in an anti-drug context, the CCA refused to put its seal on these issues. With the approval of Marvel publisher Martin Goodman, Lee had the comics published without the seal. The comics sold well and Marvel won praise for its socially conscious efforts.  The CCA subsequently loosened the Code to permit negative depictions of drugs, among other new freedoms.The \"Six-Arm Saga\" of #100-102 (Sept.–Nov. 1971) introduced Morbius, the Living Vampire. The second installment was the first Amazing Spider-Man story not written by co-creator Lee, with Roy Thomas taking over writing the book for several months before Lee returned to write #105-110 (Feb.-July 1972). Lee, who was going on to become Marvel Comics\\' publisher, with Thomas becoming editor-in-chief, then turned writing duties over to 19-year-old wunderkind Gerry Conway, who scripted the series through 1975. Romita penciled Conway\\'s first half-dozen issues, which introduced the gangster Hammerhead in #113 (Oct. 1972). Kane then succeeded Romita as penciler, although Romita would continue inking Kane for a time.The most memorable work of the Conway/Kane/Romita team was #121-122 (June–July 1973), which featured the death of Gwen Stacy at the hands of the Green Goblin in \"The Night Gwen Stacy Died\" (#121). Her demise and the Goblin\\'s apparent death one issue later formed a story arc widely considered as the most defining in the history of Spider-Man. The aftermath of the story also deepened both the characterization of Mary Jane Watson and her relationship with Parker.By late 1973, Gil Kane was succeeded by Ross Andru, whose run lasted nearly 60 issues, from 1973 to 1978. Issue #129 (Feb. 1974) introduced the Punisher, who would become one of Marvel Comics\\' most popular characters. The Conway-Andru era also featured the first appearances of the Man-Wolf in #124-125 (Sept.-Oct. 1973); the near-marriage of Doctor Octopus and Aunt May in #131 (April 1974); Harry Osborn stepping into his father\\'s role as the Green Goblin in #135-137 (Aug.-Oct.1974); and the original \"Clone Saga\", containing the introduction of Spider-Man\\'s clone, in #147-149 (Aug.-Oct. 1975). Archie Goodwin and Gil Kane produced the title\\'s 150th issue (Nov. 1975) before Len Wein became writer for two-and-a-half years. During Wein\\'s tenure, Harry Osborn and Liz Allen dated and became engaged, J. Jonah Jameson was introduced to his eventual second wife, Marla Madison, and Aunt May suffered a heart attack. Wein\\'s last story on Amazing was a five-issue arc in #176-180 (Jan.-May 1978) featuring a third Green Goblin (Harry Osborn’s psychiatrist, Bart Hamilton). Marv Wolfman, Marvel\\'s editor-in-chief from 1975 to 1976, succeeded Wein as writer, and in his first issue, #182 (July 1978), had Parker propose marriage to Watson (who refused, in the following issue). Keith Pollard succeeded Ross Andru as artist shortly afterward, and with Wolfman introduced the likable rogue the Black Cat (Felicia Hardy) in #194 (July 1979). As a love interest for Spider-Man, the Black Cat would go on to be an important supporting character for the better part of the next decade, and remain a friend and occasional lover into the 2010s. The 1980s The Amazing Spider-Man #200 (Jan. 1980) featured the return and death of the burglar who killed Spider-Man\\'s Uncle Ben. Writer Marv Wolfman and penciler Keith Pollard both left the title by mid-year, succeeded by Dennis O\\'Neil, a writer known for groundbreaking 1970s work at rival DC Comics, and penciler John Romita, Jr.. Roger Stern, who had written nearly 20 issues of sister title The Spectacular Spider-Man, took over Amazing in late 1981. During his two years on the title, Stern augmented the backgrounds of long-established Spider-Man villains, and with Romita Jr. created the mysterious supervillain the Hobgoblin in #238-239 (March–April 1983). Fans engaged with the mystery of the Hobgoblin\\'s secret identity, which continued throughout #244-245 and 249-251 (Sept.-Oct. 1983 & Feb.-April 1984). One lasting change was the reintroduction of Mary Jane Watson as a more serious, mature woman who becomes Peter\\'s confidante after she reveals that she knows his secret identity.By mid-1984, Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz took over scripting and penciling. DeFalco helped establish Parker and Watson\\'s mature relationship, laying the foundation for the characters\\' wedding in 1985. Notably, in #257 (Oct. 1984), Watson tells Parker that she knows he is Spider-Man, and in #259 (Dec. 1984), she reveals to Parker the extent of her troubled childhood. Other notable issues of the DeFalco-Frenz era include #252 (May 1984), with the first appearance of Spider-Man\\'s black costume, which the hero would wear almost exclusively for the next four years\\' worth of comics; the debut of criminal mastermind the Rose, in #253 (June 1984); the revelation in #258 (Nov. 1984) that the black costume is a living being, a symbiote; and the introduction of the female mercenary Silver Sable in #265 (June 1985).Tom DeFalco and Ron Frenz were both removed from The Amazing Spider-Man in 1986 by editor Owsley under acrimonious circumstances.  A succession of artists including Alan Kupperberg, John Romita, Jr., and Alex Saviuk penciled the book from 1987 to 1988; Owsley wrote the book for the first half of 1987, scripting the five-part \"Gang War\" story (#284-288) that DeFalco plotted. Former Spectacular Spider-Man writer Peter David scripted #289 (June 1987), which revealed Ned Leeds as being the Hobgoblin (although this was retconned in 1996 by Roger Stern into Leeds not being the original Hobgoblin after all).David Michelinie took over as writer in the next issue, for a story arc in #290-292 (July-Sept. 1987) that led to the marriage of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson in Amazing Spider-Man Annual #21. Issue #298 (March 1988) was the first Spider-Man comic to be drawn by future industry star Todd McFarlane, the first regular artist on The Amazing Spider-Man since Frenz\\'s departure. McFarlane revolutionized Spider-Man\\'s look. His depiction – large-eyed, with wiry, contorted limbs, and messy, knotted, convoluted webbing – influenced the way virtually all subsequent artists would draw the character. McFarlane\\'s other significant contribution to the Spider-Man canon was the design for what would become one of Spider-Man\\'s most wildly popular antagonists, the supervillain Venom. Issue #299 (April 1988) featured Venom\\'s first appearance (a last-page cameo) before his first full appearance in #300 (May 1988). The latter issue also featured Spider-Man reverting to his original red-and-blue costume.Other notable issues of the Michelinie-McFarlane era include #312 (Feb. 1989), featuring the Green Goblin vs. the Hobgoblin; and #315-317 (May–July 1989), with the return of Venom. After the editorial and creative turmoil that beset The Amazing Spider-Man in 1987, the Michelinie/McFarlane team at the tail-end of the 1980s restored a sense of creative consistency and quality to the book, and set the tone for Spider-Man for the next decade. In July 2012, Todd McFarlane\\'s original cover art for \"The Amazing Spider-Man\" #328 sold for a bid of $657,250, making it the most expensive American comic book art ever sold at auction.   The 1990sWith a civilian life as a married man, the Spider-Man of the 1990s was different from the superhero of the previous three decades. McFarlane left the title in 1990 to write and draw a new series titled simply Spider-Man. His successor, Erik Larsen, penciled the book from early 1990 to mid-1991. After issue #350, Larsen was succeeded by Mark Bagley, who had won the 1986 Marvel Tryout Contest and was assigned a number of low-profile penciling jobs followed by a run on New Warriors in 1990. Bagley penciled the flagship Spider-Man title from 1991 to 1996, with his art forming the basis for most Spider-Man licensed merchandise of the decade and onward. Issues #361-363 (April–June 1992) introduced Carnage, a second symbiote nemesis for Spider-Man. The series\\' 30th-anniversary issue, #365 (Aug. 1992), was a double-sized, hologram-cover issue with the cliffhanger ending of Peter Parker\\'s parents, long thought dead, reappearing alive. It would be close to two years before they were revealed to be impostors, who are killed in #388 (April 1994), scripter Michelinie\\'s last issue. His 1987–1994 stint gave him the second-longest run as writer on the title, behind Stan Lee.Issue #375 was released with a gold foil cover. However, there was an error affecting some issues and as a result, a double cover miswrap was released into circulation.With #389, writer J. M. DeMatteis, whose Spider-Man credits included the 1987 \"Kraven\\'s Last Hunt\" story arc and a 1991–1993 run on The Spectacular Spider-Man, took over the title. From October 1994 to June 1996, Amazing stopped running stories exclusive to it, and ran installments of multi-part stories that crossed over into all the Spider-Man books. One of the few self-contained stories during this period was in #400 (April 1995), which featured the death of Aunt May — later revealed to have been faked (although the death still stands in the MC2 continuity). The \"Clone Saga\" culminated with the revelation that the Spider-Man who had appeared in the previous 20 years of comics was a clone of the real Spider-Man. This plot twist was massively unpopular with many readers,  and was later reversed in the \"Revelations\" story arc that crossed over the Spider-Man books in late 1996.The Clone Saga tied into a publishing gap after #406 (Oct. 1995), when the title was temporarily replaced by The Amazing Scarlet Spider #1-2 (Nov.-Dec. 1995), featuring Ben Reilly. The series picked up again with #407 (Jan. 1996), with Tom DeFalco returning as writer. Bagley completed his 5½-year run by September 1996. A succession of artists, including Ron Garney, Steve Skroce, Joe Bennett, and Rafael Kayanan, penciled the book until the final issue, #441 (Nov. 1998), after which Marvel rebooted the title with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999). Relaunch and the 2000sMarvel began The Amazing Spider-Man anew with vol. 2, #1 (Jan. 1999).    Howard Mackie wrote the first 29 issues. The relaunch proved controversial with the Sandman being regressed to his criminal ways and the \"death\" of Mary Jane, which was ultimately reversed due to fan backlash.  Other elements included the introduction of a new Spider-Woman (who was spun off into her own short-lived series) and references to John Byrne\\'s controversial  \"Spider-Man: Chapter One\", which launched at the same time as the reboot. Mackie\\'s run ended with The Amazing Spider-Man Annual 2001, which saw the return of Mary Jane, who then left Parker upon reuniting with him.With #30 (June 2001), J. Michael Straczynski took over as writer. While his arrival saw the title regain lost readers,  Straczynski oversaw additional controversial  storylines — most notably his lengthy \"Spider-Totem\" arc, which raised the issue of whether Spider-Man\\'s powers were magic-based, rather than as the result of a radioactive spider\\'s bite. Additionally, Straczynski resurrected the plot point of Aunt May discovering her nephew was Spider-Man,  and returned Mary Jane, with the couple reuniting in The Amazing Spider-Man #50. Straczynski also gave Spider-Man a new profession, having Parker teach at his former high school.Issue #30 began a dual numbering system, with the original series numbering (#471) returned and placed alongside the volume-two number on the cover. Other longtime, rebooted Marvel Comics titles, including Fantastic Four, likewise were given the dual numbering around this time. In October 2000, John Romita, Jr. succeeded John Byrne as artist. After vol. 2, #58 (Nov. 2003), the title reverted completely to its original numbering for #500 (Dec. 2003).  Mike Deodato, Jr. penciled the book from mid-2004 until 2006.That year Peter Parker revealed his Spider-Man identity on live television in the company-crossover storyline \"Civil War\", in which the superhero community is split over whether to conform to the federal government\\'s new Superhuman Registration Act. This knowledge was erased from the world with the event of the four-part, crossover story arc, \"One More Day\", written partially by J. Michael Straczynski and illustrated by Joe Quesada, running through The Amazing Spider-Man #544-545 (Nov.-Dec. 2007), Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man #24 (Nov. 2007) and The Sensational Spider-Man #41 (Dec. 2007), the final issues of those two titles. Here, the demon Mephisto makes a Faustian bargain with Parker and Mary Jane, offering to save Parker\\'s dying Aunt May if the couple will allow their marriage to have never existed, rewriting that portion of their pasts. This story arc marked the end of Straczynski\\'s six-and-a-half years as writer (from 2001 to 2007) on the title after 75 issues (including issues of Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man and The Sensational Spider-Man as part of crossovers).Following this, Marvel made The Amazing Spider-Man the company\\'s sole Spider-Man title, increasing its frequency of publication to three issues monthly, and inaugurating the series with a sequence of \"back to basics\" story arcs under the banner of \"Brand New Day\". Parker now exists in a changed world where he and Mary Jane had never married, and Parker has no memory of being married to her, with domino effect differences in their immediate world. The most notable of these revisions to Spider-Man continuity are the return of Harry Osborn, whose death in The Spectacular Spider-Man #200 (May 1993) is erased; and the reestablishment of Spider-Man\\'s secret identity, with no one except Mary Jane able to recall that Parker is Spider-Man (although he soon reveals his secret identity to the New Avengers and the Fantastic Four). The alternating regular writers were initially Dan Slott, Bob Gale, Marc Guggenheim, Fred Van Lente, and Zeb Wells, joined by a rotation of artists that included Chris Bachalo, Phil Jimenez, Mike McKone, John Romita, Jr. and Marcos Martín. Joe Kelly, Mark Waid and Roger Stern later joined the writing team and Barry Kitson the artist roster. 2010s and end of publicationWith issue #648 (January 2011), the series became a twice-monthly title with Dan Slott as sole writer. Eight additional pages were added per issue. This publishing format lasted until issue #700, which concluded the \"Dying Wish\" storyline, in which Parker and Doctor Octopus swapped bodies, and the latter taking on the mantle of Spider-Man when Parker apparently died in Doctor Octopus\\' body. The Amazing Spider-Man ended with this issue, with the story continued in the new series The Superior Spider-Man.

Its paradigmatic  ethnographic example is the division of India\\'s Hindu society into rigid social groups, with roots in India\\'s ancient history and persisting until today.  However, the economic significance of the caste system in India has been declining as a result of urbanization and affirmative action programs. A subject of much scholarship by sociologists and anthropologists, the Hindu caste system is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside Hinduism and India.According to UNICEF and Human Rights Watch, caste discrimination affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide.   EtymologyThe English word \"caste\" derives from the Spanish and Portuguese casta, which the Oxford English Dictionary quotes John Minsheu\\'s Spanish dictionary (1599) to mean, \"race, lineage, or breed.\"     When the Spanish colonized the New World, they used the word to mean a \"clan or lineage.\"   However, it was the Portuguese who employed casta in the primary modern sense when they applied it to the many in-marrying hereditary Hindu social groups  they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498.      The use of the spelling \"caste,\" with this latter meaning, is first attested to in English in 1613.  Caste system of India    Historically, the caste system in India consisted of four well-known categories (the Varnas):  Brahmin (priests) Kshatriyas (warriors) Vaishyas (traders) Shudras (workmen) The fifth one (Refer to next paragraph) Dalits (do all the things that relates with death and other gruesome things) Some people were left out from these four caste classifications, and were called Panchama or Dalits (literally, the fifth). Regarded as outcastes or the untouchables, these were shunned and ostracized. The varnas themselves have been further subdivided into thousands of jatis.    Ancient Indian text on laws, such as Manusmṛti suggest a caste system was part of Indian society. These laws in ancient India discriminated between castes. For example, the laws of Manusmṛti declare sexual relationships between men and women of different castes as illegal.  Upon independence from the British rule, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for affirmative action.  The Scheduled Castes are sometimes called as Dalit in contemporary literature.  In 2001, the proportion of Dalit population was 16.2 percent of India\\'s total population.    Caste in rest of South Asia Nepal  The Nepalese caste system resembles that of the Indian Jāti system with numerous Jāti divisions with a Varna system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the Lichchhavi period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–95) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–75). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–36). Pakistan Religious, historical and sociocultural factors have helped define the bounds of endogamy for Muslims in some parts of Pakistan. There is a preference for endogamous marriages based on the clan-oriented nature of the society, which values and actively seeks similarities in social group identity based on several factors, including religious, sectarian, ethnic, and tribal/clan affiliation. Religious affiliation is itself multilayered and includes religious considerations other than being Muslim, such as sectarian identity (e.g. Shia or Sunni, etc.) and religious orientation within the sect (Isnashari, Ismaili, Ahmedi, etc.). Both ethnic affiliation (e.g. Sindhi, Baloch, Punjabi, etc.) and membership of specific biraderis or zaat/quoms are additional integral components of social identity.    Within the bounds of endogamy defined by the above parameters, close consanguineous unions are preferred due to a congruence of key features of group- and individual-level background factors as well as affinities. McKim Marriott claims a social stratification that is hierarchical, closed, endogamous and hereditary is widely prevalent, particularly in western parts of Pakistan. Frederik Barth in his review of this system of social stratification in Pakistan suggested that these are castes.    Sri Lanka  The Caste system in Sri Lanka is a division of society into strata,  influenced by the classic Aryan Varnas of North India and the Dravida Jāti system found in South India. Ancient Sri Lankan texts such as the Pujavaliya, Sadharmaratnavaliya and Yogaratnakaraya and inscriptional evidence show that the above hierarchy prevailed throughout the feudal period. The repetition of the same caste hierarchy even as recently as the 18th century, in the British/Kandyan period Kadayimpoth - Boundary books as well, indicates the continuation of the tradition right up to the end of Sri Lanka\\'s monarchy. Caste-like stratification outside South Asia South-east Asia MyanmarKaren are people from the Burma-Thailand border region. They were claimed by Christian missionaries and British colonialists as people who were treated by the ethnic majority as low-caste people or dirty-feeders.  Bali  Balinese caste structure has been described in early 20th century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, dwijati (twice born) in contrast to ekajati (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently than the caste categories for India:    Brahmanas - priest Satrias - knighthood Wesias - commerce Sudras - servitude The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five – Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher caste Brahmana men with lower caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to castas in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.  East Asia Japan  In Japan\\'s history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merits, was rigid and highly formalized. At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles (kuge), together with the Shogun and daimyo. Below them the population was divided into four classes in a system known as mibunsei (身分制). These were: samurai, peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only the samurai class was allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants and other craftsmen and merchants whom he felt were disrespectful. Craftsmen produced products, being the third, and the last merchants were thought to be as the meanest class because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, the peasant caste were labelled as furiuri, tanagari, mizunomi-byakusho amongst others. The castes and sub-classes, as in Europe, were from the same race, religion and culture.Howell, in his review of Japanese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan. De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that a systematic and extensive caste system was part of the Japanese society. They also discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often quickly assumed to be slightly different, are superficial terms, two faces of identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and other countries of the world.   Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.  Japan had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term Eta, now called Burakumin. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the Buraku or Burakumin underclasses.  The Burakumin are regarded as \"ostracised.\"      The burakumin are one of the main minority groups in Japan, along with the Ainu of Hokkaidō and those of residents of Korean and Chinese descent. West Asia YemenIn Yemen there exists a hereditary caste, the African-descended Al-Akhdam who are kept as perennial manual workers. A 2008 New York Times report claims that Yemen has over 1 million of these discriminated and ostracized Al-Akhdam people, that is about 5 percent of Yemen population.  Africa Various sociologists have reported caste systems in Africa.      The specifics of the caste systems have varied in ethnically and culturally diverse Africa, however the following features are common - it has been a closed system of social stratification, the social status is inherited, the castes are hierarchical, certain castes are shunned while others are merely endogamous and exclusionary.  In some cases, concepts of purity and impurity by birth have been prevalent in Africa. In other cases, such as the Nupe of Nigeria, the Beni Amer of East Africa, and the Tira of Sudan, the exclusionary principle has been driven by evolving social factors.  West Africa  Among the Igbo of Nigeria - especially Enugu, Anambra, Imo, Abia, Ebonyi, Edo and Delta states of the country - Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one\\'s birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities. The osu class systems of eastern Nigeria and southern Cameroon are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the \"Osus\" people as \"owned by deities\" and outcasts.The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders. In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in Cote d\\'lvoire, with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers. Similarly, the Mandé societies in Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Senegal and Sierra Leone have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the jonow slaves as inferior. Similarly, the Wolof in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the geer (freeborn/nobles), jaam (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass neeno. In various parts of West Africa, Fulani societies also have class divisions. Other castes include Griots, Forgerons, and Cordonniers.Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the Malinke people no later than 14th century, and was present among the Wolof and Soninke, as well as some Songhay and Fulani populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the Sosso-Malinke war described in the Sunjata epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire. As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.    Central AfricaAlbert in 1960 claimed that the societies in Central Africa were caste-like social stratification systems.  Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in Rwanda and Burundi can be best described as castes.  The Tutsi, noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous Hutu and the least numerous Twa regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.  Maquet\\'s theories have been controversial. East AfricaIn a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Rwanda and Ethiopia in communities such as the Gurage and Konso. He then presents the Dime of South-West Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited. The Borana Oromo of southern Ethiopia in the Horn of Africa also have a class system, where the Watta, an acculturated Bantu group, represent the poorest class.The traditionally nomadic Somali people are divided into clans, wherein the Rahanweyn agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the Madhiban are sometimes treated as outcasts.  Europe France and SpainFor centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded Cagots of western France and northern Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the Churches, they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.

It was founded in AD 330, at ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Constantine the Great, after whom it was named. In the 12th century, Rosenberg, Matt. \"Largest cities through history.\" About.com.  the city was the largest and wealthiest European city.  Eventually the empire of Christian Eastern Orthodoxy in the east was reduced to just the capital and its environs, falling to the Ottomans in the historic battle of 1453. The city itself remained and prospered as the Muslim capital in the Ottoman period; however, scholars normally reserve the name \"Constantinople\" for the city in Christian period 330–1453, preferring \"Istanbul\" for the city\\'s name in later centuries. However, many Western writers have continued to refer to the city by its older name \"Constantinople\" into modern times.   The name \"Constantinople\" is still used by members of the Eastern Orthodox Church in the title of one of their most important leaders, the Orthodox patriarch based in the city, referred to as \"His Most Divine All-Holiness the Archbishop of Constantinople New Rome and Ecumenical Patriarch.\"Constantinople was famed for its massive defenses. Although besieged on numerous occasions by various peoples, it was taken only in 1204 by the army of the Fourth Crusade, in 1261 by Michael VIII Palaiologos, and – finally – in 1453 by the Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. A first wall was erected by Constantine I, and the city was surrounded by a double wall lying about   to the west of the first wall, begun during the 5th century by Theodosius II. The city was built on seven hills as well as on the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara, and thus presented an impregnable fortress enclosing magnificent palaces, domes and towers. It was also famed for architectural masterpieces such as the church of Hagia Sophia, the sacred palace of the emperors, the hippodrome, and the Golden Gate, lining the arcaded avenues and squares. Constantinople contained numerous artistic and literary treasures before it was sacked in 1204 and 1453.  It was virtually depopulated when it fell to the Ottoman Turks, Müller-Wiener (1977), p. 28  but the city recovered rapidly, becoming once again by the mid-1600s the world\\'s largest city as the Ottoman capital.  Names The city was originally founded as a Greek colony under the name of Byzantium in the 7th century BC. It took on the name of Konstantinoupolis (\"city of Constantine\", Constantinople) after its re-foundation under Roman emperor Constantine I, who transferred the imperial capital from its historic base, Rome, to Byzantium in 330 AD and designated his new capital Nova Roma or \"New Rome.\" The modern Turkish name for the city, İstanbul derives from the Greek phrase eis tin polin (εις την πόλιν), meaning \"into the City\" or \"to the City\". This name was used in Turkish alongside Kostantiniyye, the more formal adaptation of the original Constantinople, during the period of Ottoman rule, while western languages mostly continued to refer to the city as Constantinople until the early 20th century. After the creation of the Republic of Turkey in 1923, the Turkish government began to formally object to the use of Constantinople in other languages and ask that others use the more common name for the city.      History Byzantium  Constantinople was founded by the Roman Emperor Constantine I (272–337 AD) on the site of an already-existing city, Byzantium, which was settled in the early days of Greek colonial expansion, probably around 671–662 BC. The site lay astride the land route from Europe to Asia and the seaway from the Black Sea to the Mediterranean, and had in the Golden Horn an excellent and spacious harbour. 306–337 Constantine had altogether more colourful plans. Having restored the unity of the Empire, and, being in course of major governmental reforms as well as of sponsoring the consolidation of the Christian church, he was well aware that Rome was an unsatisfactory capital. Rome was too far from the frontiers, and hence from the armies and the imperial courts, and it offered an undesirable playground for disaffected politicians. Yet it had been the capital of the state for over a thousand years, and it might have seemed unthinkable to suggest that the capital be moved to a different location. Nevertheless, Constantine identified the site of Byzantium as the right place: a place where an emperor could sit, readily defended, with easy access to the Danube or the Euphrates frontiers, his court supplied from the rich gardens and sophisticated workshops of Roman Asia, his treasuries filled by the wealthiest provinces of the Empire.Constantinople was built over 6 years, and consecrated on 11 May 330.  Constantine divided the expanded city, like Rome, into 14 regions, and ornamented it with public works worthy of an imperial metropolis.  Yet, at first, Constantine\\'s new Rome did not have all the dignities of old Rome. It possessed a proconsul, rather than an urban prefect. It had no praetors, tribunes, or quaestors. Although it did have senators, they held the title clarus, not clarissimus, like those of Rome. It also lacked the panoply of other administrative offices regulating the food supply, police, statues, temples, sewers, aqueducts, or other public works. The new programme of building was carried out in great haste: columns, marbles, doors, and tiles were taken wholesale from the temples of the empire and moved to the new city. In similar fashion, many of the greatest works of Greek and Roman art were soon to be seen in its squares and streets. The emperor stimulated private building by promising householders gifts of land from the imperial estates in Asiana and Pontica and on 18 May 332 he announced that, as in Rome, free distributions of food would be made to the citizens. At the time, the amount is said to have been 80,000 rations a day, doled out from 117 distribution points around the city. Constantine laid out a new square at the centre of old Byzantium, naming it the Augustaeum. The new senate-house (or Curia) was housed in a basilica on the east side. On the south side of the great square was erected the Great Palace of the Emperor with its imposing entrance, the Chalke, and its ceremonial suite known as the Palace of Daphne. Nearby was the vast Hippodrome for chariot-races, seating over 80,000 spectators, and the famed Baths of Zeuxippus. At the western entrance to the Augustaeum was the Milion, a vaulted monument from which distances were measured across the Eastern Roman Empire.From the Augustaeum led a great street, the Mese (Greek: Μέση [Οδός] lit. \"Middle [Street]\"), lined with colonnades. As it descended the First Hill of the city and climbed the Second Hill, it passed on the left the Praetorium or law-court. Then it passed through the oval Forum of Constantine where there was a second Senate-house and a high column with a statue of Constantine himself in the guise of Helios, crowned with a halo of seven rays and looking toward the rising sun. From there the Mese passed on and through the Forum Tauri and then the Forum Bovis, and finally up the Seventh Hill (or Xerolophus) and through to the Golden Gate in the Constantinian Wall. After the construction of the Theodosian Walls in the early 5th century, it was extended to the new Golden Gate, reaching a total length of seven Roman miles.  337–527The first known Prefect of the City of Constantinople was Honoratus, who took office on 11 December 359 and held it until 361. The emperor Valens built the Palace of Hebdomon on the shore of the Propontis near the Golden Gate, probably for use when reviewing troops. All the emperors up to Zeno and Basiliscus were crowned and acclaimed at the Hebdomon. Theodosius I founded the Church of John the Baptist to house the skull of the saint (today preserved at the Topkapı Palace in Istanbul, Turkey), put up a memorial pillar to himself in the Forum of Taurus, and turned the ruined temple of Aphrodite into a coach house for the Praetorian Prefect; Arcadius built a new forum named after himself on the Mese, near the walls of Constantine.The importance of Constantinople gradually increased. After the shock of the Battle of Adrianople in 378, in which the emperor Valens with the flower of the Roman armies was destroyed by the Visigoths within a few days\\' march, the city looked to its defences, and  in 413–414, Theodosius II built the 18-meter (60-foot)-tall triple-wall fortifications, which were never to be breached until the coming of gunpowder. Theodosius also founded a University near the Forum of Taurus, on 27 February 425.Uldin, a prince of the Huns, appeared on the Danube about this time and advanced into Thrace, but he was deserted by many of his followers, who joined with the Romans in driving their king back north of the river. Subsequent to this, new walls were built to defend the city, and the fleet on the Danube improved.In due course, the barbarians overran the Western Roman Empire: Its emperors retreated to Ravenna, and it diminished to nothing. Thereafter, Constantinople became in truth the largest city of the Roman Empire and of the world. Emperors were no longer peripatetic between various court capitals and palaces. They remained in their palace in the Great City, and sent generals to command their armies. The wealth of the eastern Mediterranean and western Asia flowed into Constantinople. 527–565 The emperor Justinian I (527–565) was known for his successes in war, for his legal reforms and for his public works. It was from Constantinople that his expedition for the reconquest of the former Diocese of Africa set sail on or about 21 June 533. Before their departure, the ship of the commander Belisarius was anchored in front of the Imperial palace, and the Patriarch offered prayers for the success of the enterprise. After the victory, in 534, the Temple treasure of Jerusalem, looted by the Romans in 70 AD and taken to Carthage by the Vandals after their sack of Rome in 455, was brought to Constantinople and deposited for a time, perhaps in the Church of St. Polyeuctus, before being returned to Jerusalem in either the Church of the Resurrection or the New Church. Chariot-racing had been important in Rome for centuries. In Constantinople, the hippodrome became over time increasingly a place of political significance. It was where (as a shadow of the popular elections of old Rome) the people by acclamation showed their approval of a new emperor, and also where they openly criticized the government, or clamoured for the removal of unpopular ministers. In the time of Justinian, public order in Constantinople became a critical political issue.Throughout the late Roman and early Byzantine periods, Christianity was resolving fundamental questions of identity, and the dispute between the orthodox and the monophysites became the cause of serious disorder, expressed through allegiance to the horse-racing parties of the Blues and the Greens. The partisans of the Blues and the Greens were said  to affect untrimmed facial hair, head hair shaved at the front and grown long at the back, and wide-sleeved tunics tight at the wrist; and to form gangs to engage in night-time muggings and street violence. At last these disorders took the form of a major rebellion of 532, known as the \"Nika\" riots (from the battle-cry of \"Victory!\" of those involved).Fires started by the Nika rioters consumed Constantine\\'s basilica of St Sophia, the city\\'s principal church, which lay to the north of the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned Anthemius of Tralles and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable St Sophia. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets.  The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, \"O Solomon, I have outdone thee!\"  St Sophia was served by 600 people including 80 priests, and cost 20,000 pounds of gold to build. T. Madden, Crusades: The Illustrated History, 114. Justinian also had Anthemius and Isidore demolish and replace the original Church of the Holy Apostles built by Constantine with a new church under the same dedication. This was designed in the form of an equal-armed cross with five domes, and ornamented with beautiful mosaics. This church was to remain the burial place of the Emperors from Constantine himself until the 11th century. When the city fell to the Turks in 1453, the church was demolished to make room for the tomb of Mehmet II the Conqueror. Justinian was also concerned with other aspects of the city\\'s built environment, legislating against the abuse of laws prohibiting building within   of the sea front, in order to protect the view. During Justinian I\\'s reign, the city\\'s population reached about 500,000 people.  However, the social fabric of Constantinople was also damaged by the onset of the Plague of Justinian between 541–542 AD. It killed perhaps 40% of the city\\'s inhabitants.  Survival, 565–717In the early 7th century, the Avars and later the Bulgars overwhelmed much of the Balkans, threatening Constantinople from the west. Simultaneously, the Persian Sassanids overwhelmed the Prefecture of the East and penetrated deep into Anatolia. Heraclius, son to the exarch of Africa, set sail for the city and assumed the purple. He found the military situation so dire that he is said at first to have contemplated withdrawing the imperial capital to Carthage, but relented after the people of Constantinople begged him to stay. The citizens lost their right to free grain in 618 when Heraclius realised that the city no longer could be supplied from Egypt as a result of the Persian wars: the population dropped substantially in size as a result. While the city withstood a siege, Heraclius campaigned deep into Persian territory and briefly restored the status quo in 628,  when the Persians surrendered all their conquests. However, further sieges followed in the course of attacks from the Arabs, a first from 674 to 678, and a second from 717 to 718. At this time the Theodosian Walls kept the city impregnable from the land, while a newly discovered incendiary substance known as \"Greek Fire\" allowed the Byzantine navy to destroy the Arab fleets and keep the city supplied. In the second siege, decisive help was rendered by the Bulgars. 717–1025 In the 730s Leo III carried out extensive repairs of the Theodosian walls, which had been damaged by frequent and violent attacks; this work was financed by a special tax on all the subjects of the Empire. Theodora, widow of the Emperor Theophilus (died 842), acted as regent during the minority of her son Michael III, who was said to have been introduced to dissolute habits by her brother Bardas. When Michael assumed power in 856, he became known for excessive drunkenness, appeared in the hippodrome as a charioteer and burlesqued the religious processions of the clergy. He removed Theodora from the Great Palace to the Carian Palace and later to the monastery of Gastria, but, after the death of Bardas, she was released to live in the palace of St Mamas; she also had a rural residence at the Anthemian Palace, where Michael was assassinated in 867. In 860, an attack was made on the city by a new principality set up a few years earlier at Kiev by Askold and Dir, two Varangian chiefs: Two hundred small vessels passed through the Bosporus and plundered the monasteries and other properties on the suburban Prince\\'s Islands. Oryphas, the admiral of the Byzantine fleet, alerted the emperor Michael, who promptly put the invaders to flight; but the suddenness and savagery of the onslaught made a deep impression on the citizens. In 980, the emperor Basil II received an unusual gift from Prince Vladimir of Kiev: 6,000 Varangian warriors, which Basil formed into a new bodyguard known as the Varangian Guard. They were known for their ferocity, honour, and loyalty. It is said that, in 1038, they were dispersed in winter quarters in the Thracesian theme when one of their number attempted to violate a countrywoman, but in the struggle she seized his sword and killed him; instead of taking revenge, however, his comrades applauded her conduct, compensated her with all his possessions, and exposed his body without burial as if he had committed suicide.  However, following the death of an Emperor, they became known also for plunder in the Imperial palaces.  Later in the 11th Century the Varangian Guard became dominated by Anglo-Saxons who preferred this way of life to subjugation by the new Norman kings of England. The Book of the Eparch, which dates to the 10th century, gives a detailed picture of the city\\'s commercial life and its organization at that time. The corporations in which the tradesmen of Constantinople were organised were supervised by the Eparch, who regulated such matters as production, prices, import, and export. Each guild had its own monopoly, and tradesmen might not belong to more than one. It is an impressive testament to the strength of tradition how little these arrangements had changed since the office, then known by the Latin version of its title, had been set up in 330 to mirror the urban prefecture of Rome. In the 9th and 10th centuries, Constantinople had a population of between 500,000 and 800,000.  Iconoclast controversyIn the 8th and 9th centuries, the iconoclast movement caused serious political unrest throughout the Empire. The emperor Leo III issued a decree in 726 against images, and ordered the destruction of a statue of Christ over one of the doors of the Chalke, an act that was fiercely resisted by the citizens.  Constantine V convoked a church council in 754, which condemned the worship of images, after which many treasures were broken, burned, or painted over with depictions of trees, birds or animals: One source refers to the church of the Holy Virgin at Blachernae as having been transformed into a \"fruit store and aviary\".  Following the death of his son Leo IV in 780, the empress Irene restored the veneration of images through the agency of the Second Council of Nicaea in 787.The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, only to be resolved once more in 843 during the regency of Empress Theodora, who restored the icons. These controversies contributed to the deterioration of relations between the Western and the Eastern Churches. Prelude to the Comnenian period, 1025–1081In the late 11th century catastrophe struck with the unexpected and calamitous defeat of the imperial armies at the Battle of Manzikert in Armenia in 1071. The Emperor Romanus Diogenes was captured. The peace terms demanded by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, were not excessive, and Romanus accepted them. On his release, however, Romanus found that enemies had placed their own candidate on the throne in his absence; he surrendered to them and suffered death by torture, and the new ruler, Michael VII Ducas, refused to honour the treaty. In response, the Turks began to move into Anatolia in 1073. The collapse of the old defensive system meant that they met no opposition, and the empire\\'s resources were distracted and squandered in a series of civil wars. Thousands of Turkoman tribesmen crossed the unguarded frontier and moved into Anatolia. By 1080, a huge area had been lost to the Empire, and the Turks were within striking distance of Constantinople. 1081–1185 Under the Comnenian dynasty (1081–1185), Byzantium staged a remarkable recovery. In 1090–91, the nomadic Pechenegs reached the walls of Constantinople, where Emperor Alexius I with the aid of the Kipchaks annihilated their army.  In response to a call for aid from Alexius, the First Crusade assembled at Constantinople in 1096, but declining to put itself under Byzantine command set out for Jerusalem on its own account.  John II built the monastery of the Pantocrator (Almighty) with a hospital for the poor of 50 beds. With the restoration of firm central government, the empire became fabulously wealthy. The population was rising (estimates for Constantinople in the 12th century vary from some 100,000 to 500,000), and towns and cities across the realm flourished. Meanwhile, the volume of money in circulation dramatically increased. This was reflected in Constantinople by the construction of the Blachernae palace, the creation of brilliant new works of art, and general prosperity at this time: an increase in trade, made possible by the growth of the Italian city-states, may have helped the growth of the economy. It is certain that the Venetians and others were active traders in Constantinople, making a living out of shipping goods between the Crusader Kingdoms of Outremer and the West, while also trading extensively with Byzantium and Egypt. The Venetians had factories on the north side of the Golden Horn, and large numbers of westerners were present in the city throughout the 12th century. Toward the end of Manuel I\\'s reign, the number of foreigners in the city reached about 60,000–80,000 people out of a total population of about 400,000 people. J. Phillips, The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople, 144.  In 1171, Constantinople also contained a small community of 2,500 Jews. J. Phillips, The Fourth Crusade and the Sack of Constantinople, 155. In artistic terms, the 12th century was a very productive period. There was a revival in the mosaic art, for example: Mosaics became more realistic and vivid, with an increased emphasis on depicting three-dimensional forms. There was an increased demand for art, with more people having access to the necessary wealth to commission and pay for such work. According to N.H. Baynes (Byzantium, An Introduction to East Roman Civilization): \"With its love of luxury and passion for colour, the art of this age delighted in the production of masterpieces that spread the fame of Byzantium throughout the whole of the Christian world. Beautiful silks from the work-shops of Constantinople also portrayed in dazzling colour animals – lions, elephants, eagles, and griffins – confronting each other, or represented Emperors gorgeously arrayed on horseback or engaged in the chase.\" \"From the tenth to the twelfth century Byzantium was the main source of inspiration for the West. By their style, arrangement, and iconography the mosaics of St. Mark\\'s at Venice and of the cathedral at Torcello clearly reveal their Byzantine origin. Similarly those of the Palatine Chapel, the Martorana at Palermo, and the cathedral of Cefalù, together with the vast decoration of the cathedral at Monreale, demonstrate the influence of Byzantium on the Norman Court of Sicily in the twelfth century. Hispano-Moorish art was unquestionably derived from the Byzantine. Romanesque art owes much to the East, from which it borrowed not only its decorative forms but the plan of some of its buildings, as is proved, for instance, by the domed churches of south-western France. Princes of Kiev, Venetian doges, abbots of Monte Cassino, merchants of Amalfi, and the kings of Sicily all looked to Byzantium for artists or works of art. Such was the influence of Byzantine art in the twelfth century, that Russia, Venice, southern Italy and Sicily all virtually became provincial centres dedicated to its production.\" 1185–1261 On 25 July 1197, Constantinople was struck by a severe fire which burned the Latin Quarter and the area around the Gate of the Droungarios (Turkish: Odun Kapısı) on the Golden Horn.     Nevertheless, the destruction wrought by the 1197 fire paled in comparison with that brought by the Crusaders. In the course of a plot between Philip of Swabia, Boniface of Montferrat and the Doge of Venice, the Fourth Crusade was, despite papal excommunication, diverted in 1203 against Constantinople, ostensibly promoting the claims of Alexius son of the deposed emperor Isaac. The reigning emperor Alexius III had made no preparation. The Crusaders occupied Galata, broke the chain protecting the Golden Horn and entered the harbour, where on 27 July they breached the sea walls: Alexius III fled. But the new Alexius IV found the Treasury inadequate, and was unable to make good the rewards he had promised to his western allies. Tension between the citizens and the Latin soldiers increased. In January 1204, the protovestiarius Alexius Murzuphlus provoked a riot, it is presumed, to intimidate Alexius IV, but whose only result was the destruction of the great statue of Athena, the work of Phidias, which stood in the principal forum facing west.In February, the people rose again: Alexius IV was imprisoned and executed, and Murzuphlus took the purple as Alexius V. He made some attempt to repair the walls and organise the citizenry, but there had been no opportunity to bring in troops from the provinces and the guards were demoralised by the revolution. An attack by the Crusaders on 6 April failed, but a second from the Golden Horn on 12 April succeeded, and the invaders poured in. Alexius V fled. The Senate met in St Sophia and offered the crown to Theodore Lascaris, who had married into the Angelid family, but it was too late. He came out with the Patriarch to the Golden Milestone before the Great Palace and addressed the Varangian Guard. Then the two of them slipped away with many of the nobility and embarked for Asia. By the next day the Doge and the leading Franks were installed in the Great Palace, and the city was given over to pillage for three days.Sir Steven Runciman, historian of the Crusades, wrote that the sack of Constantinople is “unparalleled in history”. For the next half-century, Constantinople was the seat of the Latin Empire. The Byzantine nobility were scattered. Many went to Nicaea, where Theodore Lascaris set up an imperial court, or to Epirus, where Theodore Angelus did the same; others fled to Trebizond, where one of the Comneni had already with Georgian support established an independent seat of empire.  Nicaea and Epirus both vied for the imperial title, and tried to recover Constantinople. In 1261, Constantinople was captured from its last Latin ruler, Baldwin II, by the forces of the Nicaean emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus. 1261–1453 and the Fall of Constantinopole  Although Constantinople was retaken by Michael VIII, the Empire had lost many of its key economic resources, and struggled to survive. The palace of Blachernae in the north-west of the city became the main Imperial residence, with the old Great Palace on the shores of the Bosporus going into decline. When Michael VIII captured the city, its population was 35,000 people, but, by the end of his reign, he had succeeded in increasing the population to about 70,000 people. T. Madden, Crusades: The Illustrated History, 113.  The Emperor achieved this by summoning former residents having fled the city when the Crusaders captured it, and by relocating Greeks from the recently reconquered Peloponnese to the capital. J. Norwich, Byzantium: The Decline and Fall, 217.  In 1347, the Black Death spread to Constantinople.  In 1453, when the Ottoman Turks captured the city, it contained approximately 50,000 people. D. Nicolle, Constantinople 1453: The end of Byzantium, 32. On 29 May 1453, Turkish sultan Mehmed II \"the Conqueror\" entered Constantinople after a 53–day siege during which his cannon had torn a huge hole in the Walls of Theodosius II. Constantinople (Ottoman Turkish: Konstantiniyye) became the third capital of the Ottoman Empire. Mehmed had begun the siege on 6 April 1453. He had hired engineers to build cannons and bombs for the occasion. He also acquired scholars and imams to encourage the soldiers. He gave the Byzantine emperor Constantine Palaeologus (1449–1453) three chances to surrender the city, a duty enjoined by the Shariah (Muslim Holy Law).  Mehmed guaranteed that the city\\'s residents, including their riches, beliefs and honor, would be safe. However, Constantine did not accept these terms of surrender.  After more than a month of fighting, Mehmed’s advisors were beginning to lose hope. Against their counsel, Mehmed continued to fight. The night before the final assault, he studied the previous attempts to take the city. He was comparing ways that would work and where they would not. On the morning of May 29, 1453 the sultan ordered the call of Azan (call to prayer). Eversley, Lord. The Turkish Empire from 1288–1914. 3rd ed. Howard Fertig. New York: Howard Fertig Inc., 1924. p. 2  This was not a regular prayer session for religious reasons but rather a scare tactic. When the Byzantine forces saw the entire Ottoman army get on their knees to pray, the Byzantine army was witnessing how united the Ottoman Turks were and this worried them. As Eversley put it: \"Their minds were defeated before their bodies.\"  Once the fighting started, it went on for forty-eight days. The wall was beginning to collapse when Constantine sent a letter to the pope asking for help. In response, the pope sent five ships full of reinforcements, weapons and supplies. Another defense tactic involved Constantine blocking off the port so that the Ottoman army could not get ships into it. Mehmed had his people pave a path from oiled tree branches in order to bring eighty ships overland, and placed them into the gulf behind the enemy ships. Byzantine attempts to burn the Turkish ships failed. For the defenders, this meant loss of control over the Horn and that they were effectively cut off from reinforcements by sea. Since the Byzantine army was still holding on after that defeat, the sultan thought it was time to set up his secret weapon, a huge mobile tower. This tower could hold many soldiers who could be at the same level as the walls of the city, making it easier for them to break into Constantinople. The first group of Ottomans who entered the city were killed almost immediately, with the effect that the other Muslims began to retreat. Witnessing this, the sultan encouraged his soldiers. Soon after the sultan’s encouragement, two breeches were made in the wall allowing the Muslims to enter the city. In a last attempt to protect it, Constantine attacked the enemy sword raised; however he was defeated and killed. The city was plundered for three days.  In the end, the population which had not been able to escape was deported to Edirne, Bursa and other Ottoman cities, leaving the city deserted except for the Jews of Balat and the Genoese of Pera. Other than the variations in their stories, the battle occurs in the same manner and neither the Byzantine nor Muslim narratives portrays the opposition in a brutal, negative light.  As expected, however, each narrative portrays its side in a heroic light.  The historical narrative from the Ottoman Turkish point of view depicts Mehmed as a clever, strong conqueror: \"The sultan ordered the setting up of his secret weapon which he had invented himself.\"  By contrast, the narrative from the Byzantine side portrays final emperor Constantine Palaeologus as a valiant leader who gave his life for the cause of Orthodoxy. As quoted from a Byzantine essay: \"[Constantine] charged into the sea of the enemy soldiers, hitting left and right in a final act of defiance.\" Hatzopoulos, Dionysios (date unknown). \"The Fall of Constantinople\", p. 10. Retrieved on 2008-02-10 from    Transition to the Ottoman era 1453–1922 For more complete information on the city during the Ottoman period, see Istanbul Finally, Christian Constantinople, the old thorn in the side of generations of Muslim caliphs, was under Muslim Ottoman control. When Mehmed II finally entered Constantinople through what is now known as the Topkapi Gate, he immediately rode his horse to the Hagia Sophia, which he ordered to be sacked. He ordered that an imam meet him there in order to chant the Muslim Creed: “I testify that there is no god but God. I testify that Muhammad is the Prophet of Allah.”  This act transformed the Orthodox cathedral into a Muslim mosque, solidifying Islamic rule in Constantinople.Mehmed’s main concern with Constantinople had to do with rebuilding the city’s defenses and repopulation. Building projects were commenced immediately after the conquest, which included the repair of the walls, construction of the citadel, and building a new palace. Inalcik, Halil. “The Policy of Mehmed II toward the Greek Population of Istanbul and the Byzantine Buildings of the City.” Dumbarton Oaks Papers 23, (1969): 229–249. p. 236  Mehmed issued orders across his empire that Muslims, Christians, and Jews should resettle the city; he demanded that five thousand households needed to be transferred to Constantinople by September.  From all over the Islamic empire, prisoners of war and deported people were sent to the city: these people were called \"Sürgün\" in Turkish ( ).  Two centuries later, Ottoman traveler Evliya Çelebi gave a list of groups introduced into the city with their respective origins. Even today, many quarters of Istanbul, such as Aksaray, Çarşamba, bear the names of the places of origin of their inhabitants.  However, many people escaped again from the city, and there were several outbreaks of plague, so that in 1459 Mehmet allowed the deported Greeks to come back to the city.  This measure apparently had no great success, since French voyager Pierre Gilles writes in the middle of 16th century that the Greek population of Constantinople was unable to mention any name of the ancient Byzantine churches transformed in mosques or abandoned. This shows that the population substitution had been total. Mamboury (1953), p. 99 The 1453 defeat of the Byzantine Orthodox forces, deportation, and fitful return of the Greek-speaking ethnic community in the city have understandably led to hard feelings between ethnic Greeks and Turks into modern times. Importance CultureConstantinople was the largest and richest urban center in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea during the late Eastern Roman Empire, mostly as a result of its strategic position commanding the trade routes between the Aegean Sea and the Black Sea. It would remain the capital of the eastern, Greek-speaking empire for over a thousand years. At its peak, roughly corresponding to the Middle Ages, it was the richest and largest European city, exerting a powerful cultural pull and dominating economic life in the Mediterranean. Visitors and merchants were especially struck by the beautiful monasteries and churches of the city, in particular, Hagia Sophia, or the Church of Holy Wisdom: A Russian 14th-century traveler, Stephen of Novgorod, wrote, \"As for St Sophia, the human mind can neither tell it nor make description of it.\"It was especially important for preserving in its libraries manuscripts of Greek and Latin authors throughout a period when instability and disorder caused their mass-destruction in western Europe and north Africa: On the city\\'s fall, thousands of these were brought by refugees to Italy, and played a key part in stimulating the Renaissance, and the transition to the modern world. The cumulative influence of the city on the west, over the many centuries of its existence, is incalculable. In terms of technology, art and culture, as well as sheer size, Constantinople was without parallel anywhere in Europe for a thousand years. International statusThe city provided a defence for the eastern provinces of the old Roman Empire against the barbarian invasions of the 5th century. The 18-meter-tall walls built by Theodosius II were, in essence, impregnable to the barbarians coming from south of the Danube river, who found easier targets to the west rather than the richer provinces to the east in Asia. From the 5th century, the city was also protected by the Anastasian Wall, a 60-kilometer chain of walls across the Thracian peninsula. Many scholars  argue that these sophisticated fortifications allowed the east to develop relatively unmolested while Ancient Rome and the west collapsed. With the emergence of Christianity and the rise of Islam, Constantinople became the last bastion of Christian Europe, standing at the fore of Islamic expansion, and repelling its influence. As the Byzantine Empire was situated in-between the Islamic world and the Christian west, so did Constantinople act as Europe’s first line-of-defence against Arab advances in the 7th and 8th centuries. The city, and the Empire, would ultimately fall to the Ottomans by 1453, but its enduring legacy had provided Europe centuries of resurgence following the collapse of Rome. Architecture  The Byzantine Empire used Roman and Greek architectural models and styles to create its own unique type of architecture. The influence of Byzantine architecture and art can be seen in the copies taken from it throughout Europe. Particular examples include St Mark\\'s Basilica in Venice, the basilicas of Ravenna, and many churches throughout the Slavic East. Also, alone in Europe until the 13th century Italian florin, the Empire continued to produce sound gold coinage, the solidus of Diocletian becoming the bezant prized throughout the Middle Ages. Its city walls were much imitated (for example, see Caernarfon Castle) and its urban infrastructure was moreover a marvel throughout the Middle Ages, keeping alive the art, skill and technical expertise of the Roman Empire. In the Ottoman period Islamic architecture and symbolism were used. ReligionConstantine\\'s foundation gave prestige to the Bishop of Constantinople, who eventually came to be known as the Ecumenical Patriarch, a situation that contributed to the Great Schism that divided Western Catholicism from Eastern Orthodoxy from 1054 onwards. Constantinople is also of great religious importance to Islam, as the conquest of Constantinople is one of the signs of the End time in Islam. Popularity Constantinople appears as a city of wondrous majesty, beauty, remoteness, and nostalgia in William Butler Yeats\\' 1928 poem \"Sailing to Byzantium\". Constantinople, as seen under the Byzantine emperor Theodosius II, makes several on-screen appearances in the television miniseries \"Attila\" as the capital of the Eastern Roman Empire. Robert Graves, author of I, Claudius, also wrote Count Belisarius, a historical novel about Belisarius. Graves set much of the novel in the Constantinople of Justinian I. Constantinople provides the setting of much of the action in Umberto Eco\\'s 2000 novel Baudolino. Constantinople\\'s change of name was the theme for a song made famous by The Four Lads and later covered by They Might Be Giants and many others entitled \"Istanbul (Not Constantinople)\". \"Constantinople\" was also the title of the opening edit of The Residents\\' EP Duck Stab!, released in 1978. Queen (band)\\'s Roger Meddows Taylor included the track \"Interlude in Constantinople\" on Side 2 of his debut album Fun in Space. Constantinople under Justinian is the scene of the book A Flame in Byzantium (ISBN 0312930267) by Chelsea Quinn Yarbro, released in 1987. \"Constantinople\" is the title of a song by The Decemberists. Stephen Lawhead\\'s novel Byzantium (1996) is set in 9th-century Constantinople. Folk Metal band Turisas makes multiple references to Constantinople in their song \"Miklagard Overture\", referring to it as \"Konstantinopolis\", \"Tsargrad\", and \"Miklagard\". Constantinople makes an appearance in the MMORPG game Silkroad as a major capital, along with a major Chinese capital. Constantinople makes an appearance in the \"Rome Total War\" expansion \"Barbarian Invasion\" belonging to the Eastern Roman Empire Constantinople also makes an appearance in \"Medieval Total War\". It is a starting province and city of the Byzantines. Constantinople makes an appearance in the game \"Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings\" in the fifth scenario of the Barbarossa campaign and again in the third scenario of the Attila the Hun campaign in the expansion pack \"Age of Empires II: The Conquerors Expansion\".

Although he is best known for discovering the dwarf planet Pluto in 1930, the first object to be discovered in what would later be identified as the Kuiper belt, Tombaugh also discovered many asteroids; he also called for the serious scientific research of unidentified flying objects. BiographyTombaugh was born in Streator, Illinois.  After his family moved to Burdett, Kansas, Tombaugh\\'s plans for attending college were frustrated when a hailstorm ruined his family\\'s farm crops.    Starting in 1926, he built several telescopes with lenses and mirrors he ground himself.  He sent drawings of Jupiter and Mars, as well as his telescopes to the Lowell Observatory. These resulted in a job offer. Tombaugh was employed at the Lowell Observatory from 1929 to 1945. Following his discovery of Pluto, Tombaugh earned bachelor\\'s and master\\'s degrees in astronomy from the University of Kansas in 1936 and 1938.  During World War II he taught naval personnel navigation at Northern Arizona University.  He worked at White Sands Missile Range in the early 1950s, and taught astronomy at New Mexico State University from 1955 until his retirement in 1973.The asteroid 1604 Tombaugh,  discovered in 1931, is named after him. He discovered hundreds of asteroids, beginning with 2839 Annette in 1929, mostly as a by-product of his search for Pluto and his searches for other celestial objects.  Tombaugh named some of them after his wife, children and grandchildren. The Royal Astronomical Society awarded him the Jackson-Gwilt Medal in 1931.  In August 1992, JPL scientist Robert Staehle called Tombaugh, requesting permission to visit his planet. \"I told him he was welcome to it,\" Tombaugh later remembered, \"though he\\'s got to go one long, cold trip.\"    The call eventually led to the launch of the New Horizons space probe to Pluto in 2006. DeathTombaugh died on January 17, 1996 in Las Cruces, New Mexico, at the age of 90. Approximately one ounce of his ashes is being carried on the New Horizons space probe. The container includes the inscription: \"Interred herein are remains of American Clyde W. Tombaugh, discoverer of Pluto and the solar system\\'s \\'third zone\\'. Adelle and Muron\\'s boy, Patricia\\'s husband, Annette and Alden\\'s father, astronomer, teacher, punster, and friend: Clyde W. Tombaugh (1906–1997)\".      Tombaugh was survived by his widow, Patricia (1912–2012), and their children: daughter Annette and son Alden.  Tombaugh was an active Unitarian-Universalist. Discovery of PlutoWhile a young researcher working for the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, Tombaugh was given the job to perform a systematic search for a trans-Neptunian planet (also called Planet X), which had been predicted by Percival Lowell and William Pickering. Tombaugh used the observatory\\'s 13-inch astrograph to take photographs of the same section of sky several nights apart. He then used a blink comparator to compare the different images. When he shifted between the two images, a moving object, such as a planet, would appear to jump from one position to another, while the more distant objects such as stars would appear stationary. Tombaugh noticed such a moving object in his search, near the place predicted by Lowell, and subsequent observations showed it to have an orbit beyond that of Neptune. This ruled out classification as an asteroid, and they decided this was the ninth planet that Lowell had predicted. The discovery was made on Tuesday, February 18, 1930, using images taken the previous month.  The name \"Pluto\" was reportedly suggested by Venetia Burney, then an 11-year-old English school girl, who died in April 2009, having lived to see the reclassification of Pluto as a dwarf planet. It won out over numerous other suggestions because it was the name of the Roman god of the underworld, who was able to render himself invisible, and because Percival Lowell\\'s initials PL formed the first 2 letters. The name Pluto was officially adopted on May 1, 1930. Following the discovery, starting in the 1990s, of other Kuiper belt objects, Pluto began to be seen not as a planet orbiting alone at 40 AU, but as the largest of a group of icy bodies in that region of space. After it was shown that at least one such body was larger than Pluto, on August 24, 2006 the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto, grouping it with two similarly sized \"dwarf planets\" rather than with the eight \"classical planets\". Tombaugh\\'s widow Patricia stated after the IAU\\'s decision that while Clyde may have been disappointed with the change since he had resisted attempts to remove Pluto\\'s planetary status in his lifetime, he would have accepted the decision now if he were alive. She noted that he \"was a scientist. He would understand they had a real problem when they start finding several of these things flying around the place.\"  Further searchTombaugh continued searching for some years after the discovery of Pluto, and the lack of further discoveries left him satisfied that no other object of a comparable apparent magnitude existed near the ecliptic. No more trans-Neptunian objects were discovered until  , in 1992.However, more recently the relatively bright object   has been discovered. It has a relatively high orbital inclination, but at the time of Tombaugh\\'s discovery of Pluto, Makemake was only a few degrees from the ecliptic near the border of Taurus and Auriga  at an apparent magnitude of 16.    This position was also very near the galactic equator, making it almost impossible to find such an object within the dense concentration of background stars of the Milky Way. Asteroids discovered Tombaugh discovered nearly 800 asteroids    during his search for Pluto and years of follow-up searches looking for another candidate for the postulated Planet X. Tombaugh is also credited with the discovery of periodic comet 274P/Tombaugh–Tenagra.    He also discovered hundreds of variable stars, as well as star clusters, galaxy clusters, and a galaxy supercluster.

On August 20, 1949, Tombaugh saw several unidentified objects near Las Cruces, New Mexico. He described them as six to eight rectangular lights, stating: \"I doubt that the phenomenon was any terrestrial reflection, because... nothing of the kind has ever appeared before or since... I was so unprepared for such a strange sight that I was really petrified with astonishment.\"   Tombaugh observed these rectangles of light for about 3 seconds and his wife saw them for about 1½ seconds.  He never supported the interpretation as a spaceship that has often been attributed to him.  He considered other possibilities, with a temperature inversion as the most likely cause.  From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious possibility for intelligent life on other planets, not even for Mars... The logistics of visitations from planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering.  In consideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic time scale when such visits may have possibly occurred, the odds of a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly against such an event.   A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical phenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sightings the faintness of the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it traveled away from the zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite suggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of slight contrast in reflective index, as in an inversion layer.   I have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent a lot of time where the night sky could be seen well.  This suggests that the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions or circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an interstellar visitation. Another sighting by Tombaugh a year or two later while at a White Sands observatory was of an object of −6 magnitude, four times brighter than Venus at its brightest, going from the zenith to the southern horizon in about 3 seconds. The object executed the same maneuvers as in Tombaugh\\'s first sighting. Tombaugh later reported having seen three of the mysterious green fireballs, which suddenly appeared over New Mexico in late 1948 and continued at least through the early 1950s. Despite this, the final report of Project Twinkle claimed that he \"... never observed an unexplainable aerial object despite his continuous and extensive observations of the sky.\" In 1956 Tombaugh had the following to say about his various sightings: \"I have seen three objects in the last seven years which defied any explanation of known phenomenon, such as Venus, atmospheric optic, meteors or planes. I am a professional, highly skilled, professional astronomer. In addition I have seen three green fireballs which were unusual in behavior from normal green fireballs... I think that several reputable scientists are being unscientific in refusing to entertain the possibility of extraterrestrial origin and nature.\"  Shortly after this in January 1957, in an Associated Press article in the Alamogordo Daily News titled \"Celestial Visitors May Be Invading Earth\\'s Atmosphere,\" Tombaugh was again quoted on his sightings and opinion about them. \"Although our own solar system is believed to support no other life than on Earth, other stars in the galaxy may have hundreds of thousands of habitable worlds. Races on these worlds may have been able to utilize the tremendous amounts of power required to bridge the space between the stars...\" Tombaugh stated that he had observed celestial phenomena which he could not explain, but has seen none personally since 1951 or 1952. \"These things, which do appear to be directed, are unlike any other phenomena I ever observed. Their apparent lack of obedience to the ordinary laws of celestial motion gives credence.\" In 1949, Tombaugh had also told the Naval missile director at White Sands Missile Range, Commander Robert McLaughlin, that he had seen a bright flash on Mars on August 27, 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.  Tombaugh also noted that the first atomic bomb tested in New Mexico would have lit up the dark side of the Earth like a neon sign and that Mars was coincidentally quite close at the time, the implication apparently being that the atomic test would have been visible from Mars.In June 1952, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, an astronomer acting as a scientific consultant to the Air Force\\'s Project Blue Book UFO study, secretly conducted a survey of fellow astronomers on UFO sightings and attitudes while attending an astronomy convention. Tombaugh and four other astronomers, including Dr. Lincoln LaPaz of the University of New Mexico, told Hynek about their sightings. Tombaugh also told Hynek that his telescopes were at the Air Force\\'s disposal for taking photos of UFOs, if he was properly alerted.  Near-Earth satellite searchTombaugh\\'s offer may have led to his involvement in a search for near-Earth satellites, first announced in late 1953 and sponsored by the Army Office of Ordnance Research. Another public statement was made on the search in March 1954 (photo at right), emphasizing the rationale that such an orbiting object would serve as a natural space station.  However, according to Donald Keyhoe, later director of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), the real reason for the sudden search was because two near-Earth orbiting objects had been picked up on new long-range radar in the summer of 1953, according to his Pentagon source.By May 1954, Keyhoe was making public statements that his sources told him the search had indeed been successful, and either one or two objects had been found.  However, the story did not break until August 23, 1954, when Aviation Week magazine stated that two satellites had been found only 400 and 600 miles out. They were termed \"natural satellites\" and implied that they had been recently captured, despite this being a virtual impossibility. The next day, the story was in many major newspapers. Dr. LaPaz was implicated in the discovery in addition to Tombaugh. LaPaz had earlier conducted secret investigations on behalf of the Air Force on the green fireballs and other unidentified aerial phenomena over New Mexico. LaPaz vehemently denied his involvement in the search, although the New York Times reported on August 29 that a source close to the project said that the story was true and LaPaz was indeed involved, in fact had been the one to spot and identify the objects as natural rather than artificial satellites. The same source denied the search had anything to do with flying saucers. However, both LaPaz and Tombaugh were to issue public denials that anything had been found. The October 1955 issue of Popular Mechanics magazine reported: \"Professor Tombaugh is closemouthed about his results. He won\\'t say whether or not any small natural satellites have been discovered.  He does say, however, that newspaper reports of 18 months ago announcing the discovery of natural satellites at 400 and 600 miles out are not correct. He adds that there is no connection between the search program and the reports of so-called flying saucers.\" At a meteor conference in Los Angeles in 1957, Tombaugh reiterated that his four-year search for \"natural satellites\" had been unsuccessful.  In 1959, Tombaugh was to issue a final report stating that nothing had been found in his search. His personal 16-inch telescope was reassembled and dedicated on September 17, 2009 at Rancho Hidalgo, New Mexico (near Animas, New Mexico), adjacent to Astronomy \\'s new observatory.

The Mosquito was one of the few operational, front-line aircraft of the World War II era to be constructed almost entirely of wood and, as such, was nicknamed \"The Wooden Wonder\".  In his book \"First and Last\" (page 153) Adolf Galland was very impressed by the Mosquito: amongst other things, he claimed that the Mosquito left a very faint signal on the German radar in use at the time because of its wooden construction. This trait has not been mentioned in books or other publications on the Mosquito. The Mosquito was also known affectionately as the \"Mossie\" to its crews  Originally conceived as an unarmed fast bomber, the Mosquito was adapted to many other roles during the air war, including: low- to medium-altitude daytime tactical bomber, high-altitude night bomber, pathfinder, day or night fighter, fighter-bomber, intruder, maritime strike aircraft, and fast photo-reconnaissance aircraft. It was also used by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) as a transport. When the Mosquito entered production in 1941, it was one of the fastest operational aircraft in the world. Bowman 2005, p. 21.  Entering widespread service in 1942, the Mosquito first operated as a high-speed, high-altitude photo-reconnaissance aircraft, and continued to operate in this role throughout the war. From mid-1942 to mid-1943 Mosquito bombers were used in high-speed, medium- or low-altitude missions, attacking factories, railways and other pinpoint targets within Germany and German-occupied Europe. From late 1943, Mosquito bomber units were formed into the Light Night Strike Force and used as pathfinders for RAF Bomber Command\\'s heavy-bomber raids. They were also used as \"nuisance\" bombers, often dropping 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookies\", in high-altitude, high-speed raids that German night fighters were almost powerless to intercept.As a night fighter, from mid-1942, the Mosquito was used to intercept Luftwaffe raids on the United Kingdom, most notably defeating the German aerial offensive, Operation Steinbock, in 1944. Offensively, starting in July 1942, some Mosquito night-fighter units conducted intruder raids over Luftwaffe airfields and, as part of 100 Group, the Mosquito was used as a night fighter and intruder in support of RAF Bomber Command\\'s heavy bombers, and played an important role in reducing bomber losses during 1944 and 1945. Hastings 1979, p. 240.  As a fighter-bomber in the Second Tactical Air Force, the Mosquito took part in \"special raids\", such as the attack on Amiens Prison in early 1944, and in other precision attacks against Gestapo or German intelligence and security forces. 2 TAF Mosquitos also played an important role operating in tactical support of the British Army during the 1944 Normandy Campaign. From 1943 Mosquitos were used by RAF Coastal Command strike squadrons, attacking Kriegsmarine U-boats (particularly in the 1943 Bay of Biscay offensive, where significant numbers of U-boats were sunk or damaged) and intercepting transport ship concentrations.The Mosquito saw service with the Royal Air Force (RAF) and many other air forces in the European theatre, and the Mediterranean and Italian theatres. The Mosquito was also used by the RAF in the South East Asian theatre, and by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) based in the Halmaheras and Borneo during the Pacific War.   Development By the early-mid-1930s, de Havilland established a reputation for innovative high-speed aircraft with the DH.88 Comet racer, while the later DH.91 Albatross airliner successfully pioneered the composite wood construction that the Mosquito would use. The 22-passenger Albatross could cruise at   at  , a vast improvement on the   Handley Page H.P.42 and other biplanes it was replacing.  The wooden monocoque construction not only saved weight and compensated for the low power of the de Havilland Gipsy Twelve engines used by this aircraft, but simplified production and reduced construction time. Bowman 2005, p. 9.  Air Ministry bomber requirements and conceptsOn 8 September 1936, the British Air Ministry issued Specification P.13/36, which called for a twin-engined medium bomber capable of carrying a bomb load of   for   with a maximum speed of   at  ; a maximum bomb load of   which could be carried over shorter ranges was also specified. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 30.   Major aviation firms entered heavy designs with new high-powered engines and multiple defensive turrets, leading to the production of the Avro Manchester and Handley Page Halifax. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 31. In May 1937, as a comparison to P.13/36, George Volkert, who was the chief designer of Handley Page, put forward to the Air Ministry the concept of a fast unarmed bomber. In his 20-page document, Volkert laid out plans for an aerodynamically clean medium bomber that would carry   of bombs at a cruising speed of  . There was some support for the idea in the RAF and Air Ministry; for example a Captain Liptrot, who was then Research Director Aircraft 3 (RDA3), appraised Volkert\\'s design, calculating that its top speed would exceed that of the brand new Supermarine Spitfire. There were, however, counter-arguments that, although such a design had merit, it would not necessarily maintain a speed advantage over enemy fighters for long.  The Ministry was also considering the use of non-strategic materials for aircraft production, which, in 1938, led to specification B.9/38 and the development of the Albemarle medium bomber, which was largely constructed from spruce and plywood attached to a steel-tube frame. Thus it can be seen that the idea of a small, fast bomber, possibly made out of non-strategic materials, was already gaining support at a much earlier stage than is sometimes acknowledged.  Inception of the de Havilland fast bomber Another designer who believed that meeting the P.13/36 specification would lead to a mediocre aircraft was Geoffrey de Havilland, who felt that an aerodynamically clean design, with minimal skin area, was a good concept for a bomber. He initially thought that adapting the Albatross airliner to meet the RAF\\'s requirements was a time-saving possibility. In April 1938, performance estimates were produced of a twin Rolls-Royce Merlin powered DH.91, with the Bristol Hercules and Napier Sabre as alternatives.  On 7 July 1938, Geoffrey de Havilland sent a letter to Air Marshal Wilfred Freeman, the Air Council\\'s member for Research and Development, discussing the specification and arguing that in the event of war, there would be shortages of materials such as duralumin or steel, while there should be plentiful supplies of wood. Additionally, although inferior torsionally, the strength to weight ratio of wood was as good as that of duralumin or steel, and, given such considerations, a different approach to designing a high-speed bomber was possible. After further consideration, in a follow-up letter sent to Freeman on 27 July, de Havilland stated that the P.13/36 specification could not be met by a twin Merlin powered aircraft and that either the top speed or load carrying capacity would be compromised, depending on which was paramount. For example, a larger, slower, turret armed aircraft would have a range of   carrying a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,800\\xa0kg) bomb load, with a maximum speed of   at  , and a cruising speed of   at  . De Havilland believed that such a concept was too much of a compromise, and that getting rid of some surplus equipment would lead to a better design.  On 4 October 1938, for example, de Havilland projected the performance of another design based on the D.H 91 Albatross, powered by two Merlin Xs, with a three-man crew and armed with six or eight forward firing guns, plus one or two manually operated guns and a tail turret. Based on a total loaded weight of   it would have a top speed of   and cruising speed of   at  . Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p.31. Still believing that this performance could be improved upon, and after examining more concepts based on the Albatross and the new all-metal DH.95 Flamingo, de Havilland settled on designing a completely new aircraft that would be aerodynamically clean, of wooden construction and powered by the Merlin, which offered promise of substantial future development.  The new design would be faster than all current or foreseeable enemy fighter aircraft, and could dispense with a defensive armament, which would only slow it down and make interception or losses to anti-aircraft guns more likely. Instead, high speed and good manoeuvrability would make it easier for the design to evade both fighters and ground fire.  Also, the lack of turrets meant that production would be simplified and production time reduced, with a delivery rate far in advance of any competing designs. Without armament, the crew could be reduced to a pilot and a navigator. This was in contrast to contemporary RAF design philosophy, which required well-armed heavy bombers and was much more akin to the German schnellbomber concept. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 5.  During a meeting held in early October 1938 between Geoffrey de Havilland, Charles C Walker (de Havilland\\'s chief engineer) and Air Ministry officials, the latter showed little interest in de Havilland\\'s concept and, instead, asked de Havilland to build wings for other bombers as a sub-contractor. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 6. By September 1939 de Havilland had produced preliminary estimates for both single- and twin-engined variations of light-bomber designs using different engines, while speculating on the effects of defensive armament on their designs. Buttler 2004, p. 78.  One design, completed on 6 September, was for an aircraft powered by a single    Napier Sabre, with a wingspan of   and capable of carrying a 1,000\\xa0lb (450\\xa0kg) bomb load  . On 20 September, in another letter to Wilfred Freeman, Geoffrey de Havilland wrote \"...we believe that we could produce a twin-engine bomber which would have a performance so outstanding that little defensive equipment would be needed.\"  By 4 October work had progressed to a twin engine light bomber with a wingspan of  , and powered by either Merlin or Griffon engines, with the Merlin being favoured because of its immediate availability. On 5 October 1939, with the Second World War a month old, the nucleus of a design team under the leadership of Eric Bishop, de Havilland\\'s chief designer, moved to the security and secrecy of Salisbury Hall and started work on what was now known as the DH.98. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 34. Bishop had worked on the DH.88 Comet and the Albatross under de Havilland\\'s then chief designer A. E. Hagg.  With an eye to making the DH.98 more versatile, Bishop made provision for four 20\\xa0mm cannon which could be installed in the forward half of the bomb bay, immediately under the cockpit, and firing via blast tubes and troughs under the forward fuselage. Bowman 2005, p. 11. The DH.98 was still too radical for the Air Ministry, which continued to want a heavily armed, multi-role aircraft, combining medium bomber, reconnaissance and \"general purpose\" roles, as well as being capable of maritime strike, for which torpedo carrying equipment was specified.   With the outbreak of the war, the Air Ministry became more receptive, but were still sceptical about sanctioning an unarmed bomber and thought that the Germans would produce fighters which were faster than expected.  Instead, the Ministry asked de Havilland to compromise and suggested two forward and two rear firing machine guns for defence. Bowman 2005, p. 10.  The Air Ministry also opposed a two-man bomber, wanting at the very least a third crewman to reduce the workload of the others on long flights.  The Air Council then added further requirements, such as remotely controlled guns, a top speed of   at   on two-thirds engine power, and a range of   with a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,800\\xa0kg) bomb load.  To appease the Air Ministry, de Havilland built several mock-ups with a gun turret just aft of the cockpit, but, apart from this compromise, de Havilland made no changes to the fundamentals of the design. On 12 November, at a meeting considering fast bomber ideas put forward by de Havilland, Blackburn, and Bristol, Marshal W. Freeman directed de Havilland to produce a fast aircraft, powered initially by Merlin engines, with options of using progressively more powerful engines, including the Rolls-Royce Griffon and the Napier Sabre. Although estimates for a slightly larger Griffon powered aircraft, armed with a four-gun tail turret, were presented, Freeman was able to get the requirement for defensive weapons dropped, and a draft requirement was raised calling for a high-speed light reconnaissance bomber capable of   at  . One month later, on 12 December 1939, the Vice-Chief of the Air Staff, Director General of Research and Development, Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief (AOC-in-C) of RAF Bomber Command met to finalise the details of the design and decide how it was to fit within the RAF\\'s strategic aims. The AOC-in-C still would not accept an unarmed bomber, but insisted it would be suitable for reconnaissance missions with either F8 or F24 cameras. Bowman 2005, p. 12.  After representatives of the company, the Air Ministry and the RAF\\'s operational commands had examined a full scale mock-up at Hatfield on 29 December 1939, the project finally received official backing. Buttler 2004, p. 80.   This was confirmed on 1 January 1940, when Air Marshal Freeman chaired another meeting with Geoffrey de Havilland, John Buchanan, (Deputy of Aircraft Production) and John Connolly, who was Buchanan\\'s chief of staff. Claiming the DH.98 was the \"fastest bomber in the world\", de Havilland added \"it must be useful\". Freeman supported its production for RAF service and ordered a single prototype for an unarmed bomber variant to specification B.1/40/dh, which called for a light bomber/reconnaissance aircraft powered by two   Rolls-Royce RM3SM (experimental designation for what became known as the Merlin 21) with ducted radiators, capable of carrying a 1,000\\xa0lb (450\\xa0kg) bomb load.    The aircraft was to have a speed of   at   and a cruising speed of   at   with a range of   at   on full tanks. Maximum service ceiling was to be  . On 1 March 1940, Air Marshal Roderic Hill issued a contract under Specification B.1/40, for 50 bomber-reconnaissance variants of the DH.98: this contract included the prototype, which was given the factory serial E0234.   In May 1940, specification F.21/40 was issued, calling for a long-range fighter armed with four 20mm cannon and four .303 machine guns in the nose, after which de Havilland were authorised to build a prototype of a fighter version of the DH.98. It was decided after some debate, that this prototype, given the serial number W4052, would carry Airborne Interception (AI) Mk.IV  equipment as a day and night fighter.The term Radar, which originated in the USA, was not used by the British until later in the war. By June 1940, the DH.98 had been given the name \"Mosquito\". Buttler 2004, p. 80.  Having the fighter variant helped keep the Mosquito project alive because there was still plenty of criticism over the usefulness of an unarmed bomber within the government and Air Ministry, even after the first prototype had flown and shown its capabilities.  Project Mosquito Once the design of the DH.98 had started, de Havilland built several mock-ups, the most detailed of which was at Salisbury Hall, in the hangar where E0234 was being built. Initially, this mock-up was designed with the crew completely enclosed in the fuselage behind a completely transparent nose (similar to that of the Bristol Blenheim or Heinkel He 111H), but this was quickly altered to a more solid nose with a more conventional canopy. The construction of the prototype began in March 1940, but work was cancelled again after the Battle of Dunkirk, when Lord Beaverbrook, as Minister of Aircraft Production decided there was no production capacity for aircraft like the DH.98, which was not expected to be in service until early 1941. Although Lord Beaverbrook told Air Vice-Marshal Freeman that work on the project had better stop, he did not issue a specific instruction, and Freeman ignored the request.  In June 1940, however, Lord Beaverbrook and the Air Staff ordered that production was to focus on five existing types, namely the Supermarine Spitfire, Hawker Hurricane, Vickers Wellington, Armstrong-Whitworth Whitley and the Bristol Blenheim.  Work on the DH.98 prototype stopped, and it seemed that the project would be shut down when the design team were denied the materials with which to build their prototype. Jackson 2003, p. 7. The Mosquito was only reinstated as a priority in July 1940, after de Havilland\\'s General Manager L.C.L Murray, promised Lord Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by December 1941, and this, only after Beaverbrook was satisfied that Mosquito production would not hinder de Havilland\\'s primary work of producing Tiger Moth and Oxford trainers and repairing Hurricanes as well as the licence manufacture of Merlin engines.  In promising Beaverbrook 50 Mosquitoes by the end of 1941, de Havilland was taking a gamble, because it was unlikely that 50 Mosquitos could be built in such a limited time; as it transpired only 20 Mosquitos were built in 1941, but the other 30 were delivered by mid-March 1942. During the Battle of Britain, nearly a third of de Havilland\\'s factory time was lost because the workers took cover in the factory\\'s bomb shelters.  Nevertheless, work on the prototype went quickly, such that E0234 was rolled out on 19 November 1940. In the aftermath of the Battle of Britain, the original order was changed to 20 bomber variants and 30 fighters. It was still uncertain whether the fighter version should have dual or single controls, or should carry a turret, so three prototypes were eventually built: W4052, W4053 and W4073. The latter, both turret armed, were later disarmed, to become the prototypes for the T.III trainer.  This caused some delays as half-built wing components had to be strengthened for the expected higher combat load requirements. The nose sections also had to be altered, omitting the clear perspex bomb-aimer\\'s position, to solid noses designed to house four .303 machine guns and their ammunition.  Prototypes and test flightsOn 3 November 1940, the aircraft, still coded E0234, was transported by road to Hatfield, and placed in a small blast-proof assembly building, where successful engine runs were made on 19 November. Two Merlin 21 two-speed single-stage supercharged engines were installed driving three-bladed de Havilland Hydromatic constant-speed, controllable-pitch propellers.  E0234 had a wingspan of   and was the only Mosquito to be built with Handley Page slats on the outer leading edges of the wings. Test flights showed that these were not needed and they were disconnected and faired over with doped fabric (these slats can still be seen on W4050).  On 24 November 1940, taxiing trials were carried out by Geoffrey de Havilland, Jr., who was the company\\'s chief test pilot and responsible for maiden flights. The tests were successful and the prototype was subsequently readied for flight testing, making its first flight piloted by Geoffrey de Havilland, on 25 November. The flight was made 11 months after the start of detailed design work, a remarkable achievement considering the conditions of the time. For this maiden flight, E0234, weighing 14,150\\xa0lbs (6,420\\xa0kg), took off from a   field beside the shed it was built in. John E. Walker, Chief Engine Installation designer, accompanied de Havilland. The takeoff was \"straight forward and easy\" and the undercarriage was not retracted until a considerable height was obtained. Thirsk 2006, p. 25.  The aircraft reached  , with the only problem being the undercarriage doors - which were operated by bungee cords attached to the main undercarriage legs - that remained open by some   at that speed.  This problem persisted for some time. The left wing of E0234 also had a tendency to drag to port slightly, so a rigging adjustment was carried out before further flights. Bowman 2005, p. 18.  On 5 December 1940, the prototype experienced tail buffeting at speeds between   and  . The pilot noticed this most in the control column, with handling becoming more difficult. During testing on 10 December, wool tufts were attached to the suspect areas to investigate the direction of airflow. The conclusion was that the airflow separating from rear section of the inner engine nacelles was disturbed, leading to a localised stall and the disturbed airflow was striking the tailplane, causing the buffeting. In an attempt to smooth the air flow and deflect it from striking the tailplane with such force, the company experimented with non-retractable slots, fitted to the inner engine nacelles and to the leading edge of the tailplane.  These slots, and wing root fairings fitted to the forward fuselage and leading edge of the radiator intakes, stopped some of the vibration experienced by the pilot but failed to cure the tailplane buffeting.  In February 1941, the buffeting was eliminated by incorporating triangular fillets on the trailing edge of the wings and lengthening the nacelles, the trailing edge of which curved up to fair into the fillet some   behind the wing\\'s trailing edge: this meant the flaps had to be divided into inboard and outboard sections. Bowman 2005, p. 19.  On W4050 the nacelle extensions were not as long as those fitted to production Mosquitoes: nacelles of the definitive shape and length were first fitted to the fighter prototype W4052. The extended nacelles and fillets were not fitted to the first nine PR Mk Is, some of which were converted to B Mk IV series 1 bombers. By January 1941, the prototype was carrying the military serial number W4050.   With the buffeting problems largely resolved, John Cunningham flew W4050 on 9 February 1941. He was greatly impressed by the \"lightness of the controls and generally pleasant handling characteristics\". Cunningham concluded that when the type was fitted with AI equipment, it would be a perfect replacement for the Bristol Beaufighter. During its trials on 16 January 1941, W4050 outpaced a Spitfire at  . The original estimates were that as the Mosquito prototype had twice the surface area and over twice the weight of the Spitfire Mk II, but also with twice its power, the Mosquito would end up being   faster. Over the next few months, W4050 surpassed this estimate, easily beating the Spitfire Mk II in testing at RAF Boscombe Down in February 1941, reaching a top speed of   at   altitude, compared to a top speed of   at   for the Spitfire.  On 19 February, official trials began at the Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment (A&AEE)  based at Boscombe Down, although de Havilland\\'s representative was surprised by a delay in starting the tests. Sharp and Bowyer 1971 pp. 44-45.  On 24 February, as W4050 taxied across the rough airfield, the tailwheel jammed leading to the fuselage fracturing: this was replaced by the fuselage of the Photo-Reconnaissance prototype W4051 in early March.This accident occurred because the tailwheel unit was unable to caster properly, a problem which was solved in June–July 1941 by the fitting of a Dowty unit. In spite of this setback, the Initial Handling Report 767 issued by the A&AEE stated \"The aeroplane is pleasant to fly ... Aileron control light and effective ...\" The maximum speed reached was   at  , with an estimated maximum ceiling of   and a maximum rate of climb of   at  . W4050 continued to be used for long and varied testing programs, being essentially the experimental \"workhorse\" for the Mosquito family.  In late October 1941, it was taken back to the factory to be fitted with Merlin 61s, the first production Merlins fitted with a two-speed, two-stage supercharger. The first flight with the new engines was on 20 June 1942.  W4050 recorded a maximum speed of   at   (fitted with straight-through air intakes with snowguards, engines in F.S gear) and   at   without snowguards. Thirsk 2006, p. 34. Snowguards were small, oval grids of steel mesh which were fitted in front of the opening of the carburettor air intakes. They were designed to stop ice forming in the mouth of the intake when the aircraft was operating during cold weather, or flying in the cold temperatures encountered at high altitude.In October 1942, in connection with development work on the NF Mk XV, W4050 was fitted with extended wingtips increasing the span to  , first flying in this configuration on 8 December.  Finally, fitted with high-altitude rated two-stage, two-speed Merlin 77s, it reached   in December 1943.  Soon after these flights,W4050 was grounded and was scheduled to be scrapped, but instead continued to serve as an instructional airframe at Hatfield. In September 1958, W4050 was returned to the Salisbury Hall hangar in which it had been built, was restored to its original configuration and is now one of the primary exhibits of the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre.   W4051, which was designed from the outset to be the prototype for the photo-reconnaissance versions of the Mosquito, was slated to make its first flight in early 1941. However, the fuselage fracture in W4050 meant that W4051\\'s fuselage was used as a replacement; W4051 was then rebuilt using a production standard fuselage and first flew on 10 June 1941. This prototype continued to use the short engine nacelles, single-piece trailing edge flaps and the    \"No. 1\"  tailplane used by W4050, but had production standard   wings and, thus configured, became the only Mosquito prototype to fly operationally. Thirsk 2006, p. 269. Construction of the fighter prototype, W4052 was also carried out at the secret Salisbury Hall facility. The new prototype differed from its bomber brethren in a number of ways. It was powered by   Merlin 21s and had an altered canopy structure with a flat bullet-proof windscreen. Four 20\\xa0mm (.79 in) Hispano Mk II cannon were housed in a compartment under the cockpit floor, with the breeches projecting into the bomb bay. The bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors which incorporated cartridge ejector chutes. Thirsk 2006, pp. 125, 134.  The solid nose mounted four .303 in (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns and their ammunition boxes which were accessed by a single large, sideways hinged panel.  In accordance with its role as a day/night fighter prototype W4052 was equipped with AI Mk.IV equipment, complete with an \"arrowhead\"-shaped transmission aerial mounted between the central Brownings, and receiving aerials through each outer wingtip, and it was painted in overall black RDM2a \"Special Night\" finish. The RDM2a finish was notoriously rough and it was hard to maintain: tests later proved that it could cut the top speed of a Mosquito by up to   and, by March 1942 was replaced by the black \"Night Type S\" (Night Type Smooth) finish.  It was also the first prototype constructed with the extended engine nacelles. W4052 was later tested with other modifications including bomb racks, drop tanks, barrage balloon cable cutters in the leading edge of the wings, Hamilton airscrews and braking propellers, as well as drooping aileron systems which enabled steep approaches, and a larger rudder tab. The prototype continued to serve as a test machine until it was scrapped on 28 January 1946.  W4055 flew the first operational Mosquito flight on 17 September 1941. During flight testing, the Mosquito prototypes were modified to test a number of experimental configurations. W4050 was fitted with a turret behind the cockpit for drag tests, after which the idea was abandoned in July 1941. W4052 had the first version of the Youngman Frill airbrake fitted to the fighter prototype. The frill was opened by bellows and venturi effect to provide rapid deceleration during interceptions and was tested between January - August 1942, but was also abandoned when it was discovered that lowering the undercarriage had the same effect with less buffeting.   Early on in the Mosquito\\'s operational life, the cooling intake shrouds that were to cool the exhausts on production aircraft overheated after a while. Flame dampers prevented exhaust glow on night operations, but they had an effect on performance. Multiple ejector and open-ended exhaust stubs helped solve the problem and were used in the PR.VIII, B.IX and B.XVI variants. This increased speed performance in the B.IX alone by   per hour.  Production plans and American interestThe Air Ministry had authorised mass production plans to be drawn up on 21 June 1941, by which time the Mosquito had become one of the world\\'s fastest operational aircraft.  The Air Ministry ordered 19 photo-reconnaissance (PR) models and 176 fighters. A further 50 were unspecified; in July 1941, the Air Ministry confirmed these would be unarmed fast bombers.    By the end of January 1942, contracts had been awarded for 1,378 Mosquitos of all variants, including 20 T.III trainers and 334 FB.VI bombers. Another 400 were to be built by de Havilland Canada. Bowman 2005, p. 24. On 20 April 1941, W4050 was demonstrated to Lord Beaverbrook, the Minister of Aircraft Production. The Mosquito made a series of flights, including one rolling climb on one engine. Also present were US General Henry H. Arnold and his aide Major Elwood Quesada, who wrote \"I ... recall the first time I saw the Mosquito as being impressed by its performance, which we were aware of. We were impressed by the appearance of the airplane that looks fast usually is fast, and the Mosquito was, by the standards of the time, an extremely well streamlined airplane, and it was highly regarded, highly respected.\"  The trials set up future production plans between Britain, Australia and Canada. The Americans did not pursue their interest. It was thought the Lockheed P-38 Lightning could handle the same duties just as easily. Arnold felt the design was being overlooked, and urged the strategic personalities in the United States Army Air Forces to learn from the design if they chose not to adopt it. Several days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the USAAF then requested one airframe to evaluate on 12 December 1941, signifying that the USAAF realised that they had entered the war without a fast dual-purpose reconnaissance aircraft. Bowman 2005, p. 20.  Design OverviewThe Mosquito was a fast, twin-engined aircraft with shoulder-mounted wings.  The most produced variant, designated the FB Mk VI (Fighter-bomber Mark 6), was powered by two Merlin Mk 23 or Mk 25 engines driving three-bladed de Havilland hydromatic propellers.  The typical fixed armament for an FB Mk VI was four Browning .303 machine guns and four 20\\xa0mm Hispano cannon while the offensive load consisted of up to   of bombs, or eight RP-3 unguided rockets.  ConstructionThe oval-section fuselage was a frameless monocoque shell built in two halves being formed to shape by band clamps over a mahogany or concrete mould, each holding one half of the fuselage, split vertically. The shell halves were made of sheets of Ecuadorean balsawood sandwiched between sheets of Canadian birch, but in areas needing extra strength— such as along cut-outs— stronger woods replaced the balsa filler; the overall thickness of the birch and balsa sandwich skin was only 7/16 in (11.11mm). This sandwich skin was so stiff no internal reinforcement was necessary from the wing\\'s rear spar to the tail bearing bulkhead.  The join was along the vertical centre line. Batchelor and Lowe 2008, p. 7.  This split construction greatly aided the assembly of the internal equipment as it allowed the technicians easy access to the fuselage interior. Bowman 2005, p. 15.  While the glue in the plywood skin dried, carpenters cut a sawtooth joint into the edges of the fuselage shells, while other workers installed the controls and cabling on the inside wall. When the glue completely dried, the two halves were glued and screwed together. The fuselage was strengthened internally by seven bulkheads made up of two plywood skins parted by spruce blocks, which formed the basis on each half for the outer shell.  Each bulkhead was a repeat of the spruce design for the fuselage halves; a balsa sheet sandwich between two plywood sheets/skins. Bulkhead number seven carried the fittings and loads for the tailplane and rudder, The type of glue originally used was Casein resin, which was later replaced by \"Aerolite\", a synthetic urea-formaldehyde, which was more durable. Aerolite was developed by Dr. Norman de Bruyne at Aero Research Limited (ARL)   The de Havilland company also pioneered the use of radio frequency (RF) heating to accelerate curing of the adhesive.  Many other types of screws and flanges (made of various woods) also held the structure together. The fuselage construction joints were made from balsa wood and plywood strips with the spruce multi-ply being connected by a balsa V joint, along with the interior frame. The spruce would be reinforced by plywood strips at the point where the two halves joined to form the V-joint. Located on top of the joint the plywood formed the outer skin.  During the joining of the two halves (\"boxing up\"), two laminated wooden clamps would be used in the after portion of the fuselage to act as support.  Jackson 2003, p. 8.  A covering of doped Madapolam (a fine plain woven cotton) fabric was stretched tightly over the shell and a coat of silver dope was applied, after which the exterior camouflage was applied.  The fuselage had a large ventral section cut-out, which was braced during construction, to allow it to be lowered onto the wing centre-section. Once the wing was secured the lower panels were replaced, and the bomb bay or armament doors fitted. The all-wood wing was built as a one-piece structure and was not divided into separate construction sections. It was made up of two main spars, spruce and plywood compression ribs, stringers, and a plywood covering. The outer plywood skin was covered and doped like the fuselage. The wing was installed into the roots by means of four large attachment points.  The engine radiators were fitted in the inner wing, just outboard of the fuselage on either side. These gave less drag.  The radiators themselves were split into three sections: an oil cooler section outboard, the middle section forming the coolant radiator and the inboard section serving the cabin heater. Jackson 2003, p. 87.  The wing contained metal framed and skinned ailerons, but the flaps were made of wood and were hydraulically controlled. The nacelles were mostly wood, although, for strength, the engine mounts were all metal as were the undercarriage parts.  Jackson 2003, p. 9.  Engine mounts of welded steel tube were added, along with simple landing gear oleos filled with rubber blocks. Wood was used to carry only in-plane loads, with metal fittings used for all triaxially loaded components such as landing gear, engine mounts, control surface mounting brackets, and the wing-to-fuselage junction.  The outer leading wing edge had to be brought   further forward to accommodate this design.  The main tail unit was all wood built. The control surfaces, the rudder and elevator were aluminium framed and fabric covered.   The total weight of metal castings and forgings used in the aircraft was only  . \"History of the de Havilland Mosquito.\" RAAF Museum Point Cook, 2007. Retrieved 13 August 2009. In November 1944, several crashes occurred in the Far East. At first, it was thought these were as a result of wing structure failures. The casein glue, it was said, cracked when exposed to extreme heat and/or monsoon conditions. This caused the upper surfaces to \"lift\" from the main spar. An investigating team led by Major Hereward de Havilland travelled to India and produced a report in early December 1944 stating that \"the accidents were not caused by the deterioration of the glue but by shrinkage of the airframe during the wet monsoon season\". However a later inquiry by Cabot & Myers definitely attributed the accidents to faulty manufacture and this was confirmed by a further investigation team by the Ministry of Aircraft Production at Defford which found faults in six different Marks of Mosquito (all built at De Havilland`s Hatfield and Leavesden plants) which showed similar defects, and none of the aircraft had been exposed to monsoon conditions or termite attack; thus it was concluded that there were construction defects found at the two plants. It was found that the \"Standard of glueing...left much to be desired”. Bowman 2005, pp. 15–16.   Records at the time showed that accidents caused by \"loss of control\" were three times more frequent on  Mosquitoes that on any other type of aircraft. The Air Ministry forestalled any loss of confidence in the Mosquito by holding to Major De Havilland`s initial investigation in India that the accidents were caused \"largely by climate\"    To solve the problem, a sheet of plywood was set along the span of the wing to seal the entire length of the skin joint along the main spar.  SystemsThe fuel systems allowed the Mosquito to have a good range and endurance, using up to nine fuel tanks. Two outer wing tanks each contained   of fuel. Air Ministry 1945, p. 11. (FB 6 notes).  These were complemented by two inner wing fuel tanks, each containing  , located between the wing root and engine nacelle. In the central fuselage were twin   fuel tanks mounted between bulkhead number two and three aft of the cockpit. Bowman 2005, p. 22.  Both the inner wing, and fuselage tanks are listed as the \"main tanks\" and the total internal fuel load of   was initially deemed appropriate for the type.  In addition, the FB Mk VI could have larger fuselage tanks, increasing the capacity to  .  Drop tanks of   or   could be mounted under each wing, increasing the total fuel load to   . In order to reduce fuel vaporisation at the high altitudes at which the photographic reconnaissance variants flew, the central and inner wing tanks were pressurised. The pressure venting cock located behind the pilot\\'s seat controlled the pressure valve; as the altitude increased, the valve increased the volume applied by a pump. This system was extended to include field modifications of the fuel tank system.  The engine oil tanks were in the engine nacelles. Each nacelle contained a   oil tank, including a   air space. The oil tanks themselves had no separate coolant controlling systems. The coolant header tank was in the forward nacelle, behind the propeller. The remaining coolant systems were controlled by the coolant radiators shutters in the forward inner wing compartment, between the nacelle and the fuselage and behind the main engine cooling radiators which were fitted in the leading edge. Electric-pneumatic operated radiator shutters directed and controlled airflow through the ducts and into the coolant valves, to predetermined temperatures. Air Ministry 1945, p. 14. (FB 6 notes). Electrical power came from a 24 volt DC generator on the starboard (No. 2) engine and an alternator on the port engine which supplied AC power for radios.  The radio shutters, superchargers, gun camera, bomb bay, bomb/rocket release and all the other crew controlled instruments were powered by a 24 volt battery.  The radio communication devices included VHF and HF communications, GEE navigation, and IFF and G.P devices.  The electric generators also powered the fire extinguishers. Located on the starboard side of the cockpit, the switches would operate automatically in the event of a crash. In flight, a warning light would flash to indicate a fire, should the pilot not already be aware of it. In later models, to save liquids and engine clean up time in case of belly landing, the fire extinguisher was changed to semi-automatic triggers. Air Ministry 1945, p. 44. (FB 6 notes).  The design of the Mark VI allowed for a provisional long-range fuel tank to increase range for action over enemy territory, for the installation of bomb release equipment specific for depth charges for strikes against enemy shipping, or for the simultaneous use of rocket projectiles along with a   drop tank under each wing supplementing the main fuel cells.  The FB.VI had a wingspan of  , a length (over guns) of  . It had a maximum speed of   at  . Maximum take-off weight was   and the range of the aircraft was   with a service ceiling of  .  The main landing gear were housed in the nacelles behind the engines. These were raised and lowered hydraulically. The main landing gear shock absorbers were de Havilland manufactured and used a system of rubber in compression, rather than hydraulic oleos, with twin pneumatic brakes for each wheel. Bishop 1995, Appendix 1  The Dunlop-Marstrand anti-shimmy tailwheel was retractable. Flight characteristicsThe design was noted for having light and effective control surfaces which allowed for good manoeuvrability. It was noted that the rudder should not be used aggressively at high speeds and the poor aileron control at low speeds when landing and taking off was also a problem for inexperienced crews.  For flying at low speeds, the flaps had to be set at 15°, speed reduced to   and rpm set to 2,650. The speed could be reduced to an acceptable   for low speed flying.  For cruising the maximum speed for obtaining maximum range was   at   weight. The Mosquito had a low stall speed of   with undercarriage and flaps raised. When both were lowered, the stall speed decreased to  . Stall speed at normal approach angle and conditions was  . Warning of the stall was given by buffeting and would occur   before stall was reached. The conditions and impact of the stall were not severe. The wing did not drop unless the control column was pulled back. The nose drooped gently and recovery was easy. Air Ministry 1945, p. 29. (FB 6 notes).  Operational history   The de Havilland Mosquito operated in many roles during the Second World War, being tasked to perform medium bomber, reconnaissance, tactical strike, anti-submarine warfare and shipping attack and night fighter duties, both defensive and offensive, until the end of the war.  The Mosquito was first announced publicly on 26 September 1942 after the Oslo Mosquito raid of 25 September. The Mosquito flew its last official European war mission on 21 May 1945, when Mosquitos of 143 Squadron and 248 Squadron RAF were ordered to continue to hunt German submarines that might be tempted to continue the fight; instead of submarines all the Mosquitos encountered were passive E-boats. Mosquitos were widely used by the RAF Pathfinder Force, marking targets for the main night-time strategic bombing force, as well as flying \"nuisance raids\" in which Mosquitos often dropped 4,000\\xa0lb \"Cookies\". Despite an initially high loss rate, the Mosquito ended the war with the lowest losses of any aircraft in RAF Bomber Command service. Post war, the RAF found that when finally applied to bombing, in terms of useful damage done, the Mosquito had proved 4.95 times cheaper than the Lancaster.  In April 1943, in response to \"political humiliation\" caused by the Mosquito,  Hermann Göring ordered the formation of special Luftwaffe units (Jagdgeschwader 25, commanded by Oberstleutnant Herbert Ihlefeld and Jagdgeschwader 50, under Major Hermann Graf) to combat the Mosquito attacks, though these units, which were \"little more than glorified squadrons\", were not very successful  against the elusive RAF aircraft. Caldwell and Muller 2007, p. 79.  Some of the most successful RAF pilots flew the Mosquito. Bob Braham claimed around a third of his 29 kills in a Mosquito, flying mostly daytime operations, while on night fighters Wing Commander Branse Burbridge claimed 21 kills, and Wing Commander John Cunningham claimed 19 of his 20 victories at night on Mosquitos.One Mosquito is listed as belonging to German secret operations unit Kampfgeschwader 200, which tested, evaluated and sometimes clandestinely operated captured enemy aircraft during the war. The aircraft was listed on the order of battle of Versuchsverband OKLs, 2 Staffel, Stab Gruppe on 10 November and 31 December 1944. However, on both lists, the Mosquito is listed as unserviceable.  Göring\\'s commentsThe Mosquito famously annoyed Luftwaffe Commander in Chief Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring when on 20 January 1943, the 10th anniversary of the Nazis\\' seizure of power, a Mosquito attack knocked out the main Berlin broadcasting station, putting his speech off air. Göring complained about the high speed of the aircraft and its wooden structure, built by a nation he considered to have large metal reserves, while Germany had shortages of such materials and could not produce such a design.   VariantsUntil the end of 1942 the RAF always used Roman numerals (I, II, ...) for mark numbers; 1943-1948 was a transition period during which new aircraft entering service were given Arabic numerals (1, 2, ...) for mark numbers, but older aircraft retained their Roman numerals. From 1948 onwards, Arabic numerals were used exclusively. PrototypesThree prototypes were built, each with a different configuration. The first to fly was W4050 on 25 November 1940, followed by the fighter W4052 on 15 May 1941 and the photo-reconnaissance prototype W4051 on 10 June 1941. W4051 later flew operationally with  1 Photographic Reconnaissance Unit (1 PRU). Photo-reconnaissanceTen Mosquito PR Mk Is were built, four of them \"long range\" versions equipped with a   overload fuel tank in the fuselage.  The contract called for ten of the PR Mk I airframes to be converted to B Mk IV Series 1s.   All of the PR Mk Is, and the B Mk IV Series 1s, had the original short engine nacelles and short span (19\\xa0ft 5.5 in) tailplanes. Their engine cowlings incorporated the original pattern of integrated exhaust manifolds which, after a relatively brief flight time, had a troublesome habit of burning and blistering the cowling panels.  The first operational sortie by a Mosquito was made by a PR Mk I, W4055, on 17 September 1941; during this sortie the unarmed Mosquito PR.I evaded three Messerschmitt Bf 109s at  . Bowman 2005, p. 27.  Powered by two Merlin 21s, the PR Mk I had a maximum speed of  , a cruise speed of  , a ceiling of  , a range of  , and a climb rate of   per minute. Over 30 Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were converted into the PR Mk IV photo-reconnaissance aircraft.  The first operational flight by a PR Mk IV was made by DK284 in April 1942. Bowman 2005, p. 164. The Mosquito PR Mk VIII, built as a stopgap pending the introduction of the refined PR Mk IX, was the next photo-reconnaissance version. The five VIIIs were converted from B Mk IVs and became the first operational Mosquito version to be powered by two-stage, two-speed supercharged engines, using 1,565\\xa0hp (1,167\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 61 engines in place of Merlin 21/22s. The first PR Mk VIII, DK324 first flew on 20 October 1942. Thirsk 2006, p. 272.  The PR Mk VIII had a maximum speed of 436\\xa0mph (700\\xa0km/h), a cruise speed of 258\\xa0mph (415\\xa0km/h), a ceiling of 38,000\\xa0ft (11,580 m), a range of 2,550\\xa0nm (4,100\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,500\\xa0ft per minute (760 m). Bowman 2005, p. 25. The Mosquito PR Mk IX, 90 of which were built, was the first Mosquito variant  with two-stage, two-speed engines to be produced in quantity; the first of these, LR405, first flew in April 1943.  The PR Mk IX was based on the Mosquito B Mk IX bomber and was powered by two 1,680\\xa0hp (1,253\\xa0kW) Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 engines. It could carry either two  , two   or two   droppable fuel tanks. The Mosquito PR Mk XVI had a pressurised cockpit and, like the Mk IX, was powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 72/73 or 76/77 piston engines. This version was equipped with three overload fuel tanks, totalling   in the bomb bay, and could also carry two   or   drop tanks.  A total of 435 of the PR Mk XVI were built.  The PR Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 415\\xa0mph (668\\xa0km/h), a cruise speed of 250\\xa0mph (402\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 38,500\\xa0ft (11,730 m), a range of 2,450\\xa0nm (3,942\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,900 feet per minute (884 m). The Mosquito PR Mk 32 was a long-range, high-altitude, pressurised photo-reconnaissance version. It was powered by a pair of two-stage supercharged 1,960\\xa0hp (1,260\\xa0kW) Rolls-Royce Merlin 113 and Merlin 114 piston engines, the Merlin 113 on the starboard side and the Merlin 114 on the port. First flown in August 1944, only five were built and all were conversions from PR.XVIs. Bowman 2005, p. 165. The Mosquito PR Mk 34 and PR Mk 34A was a very long-range unarmed high altitude photo-reconnaissance version. The fuel tank and cockpit protection armour were removed. Additional fuel was carried in a bulged bomb bay: 1,192 gallons which was the equivalent of  . A further two 200 gallon (910 litre) drop tanks under the outer wings gave a range of 3,600 miles (5,800\\xa0km) cruising at 300\\xa0mph (480\\xa0km/h). Powered by two 1,690\\xa0hp (1,259\\xa0kW) Merlin 114s first used in the PR.32. The port Merlin 114 drove a Marshal cabin supercharger. A total of 181 were built, including 50 built by Percival Aircraft Company at Luton.  The PR.34\\'s maximum speed (TAS) was   at sea level,   at   and   at  . \"The latest Mosquitoes.\" Flight, 28 February 1946 via flightglobal.com. Retrieved 17 August 2010.  All PR.34s were installed with four split F52 vertical cameras, two forward, two aft of the fuselage tank and one F24 oblique camera. Sometimes a K-17 camera was used for air surveys. In August 1945, the PR.34A was the final photo-reconnaissance variant with one Merlin 113A and 114A each delivering 1,710\\xa0hp (1,274\\xa0kW). Bowman 2005, p. 166. Colonel Roy M. Stanley II, USAF (RET) wrote: \"I consider the Mosquito the best photo-reconnaissance aircraft of the war\". Stanley 2010, p. 35.  Bombers On 21 June 1941 the Air Ministry ordered that the last 10 Mosquitoes, ordered as photo-reconnaissance aircraft, should be converted to bombers. These 10 aircraft were part of the original 1 March 1940 production order and became the B Mk IV Series 1. W4052 was to be the prototype and flew for the first time on 8 September 1941. Bowman 2005, pp. 22–23. The bomber prototype led to the B Mk IV, of which 273 were built: apart from the 10 Series 1s, all of the rest were built as Series 2s with extended nacelles, revised exhaust manifolds, with integrated flame dampers, and larger tailplanes. Jackson 2003, p. 15.  Series 2 bombers also differed from the Series 1 in having a larger bomb bay to increase the payload to four   bombs, instead of the four 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) bombs of Series 1. This was made possible by shortening the tail of the 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bomb so that these four larger weapons could be carried (or a 2,000\\xa0lb (920;kg) total load).  The B Mk IV entered service in May 1942 with 105 Squadron. In April 1943 it was decided to convert a B Mk IV to carry a 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg), thin-cased high explosive bomb (nicknamed \"Cookie\"). The conversion, including modified bomb bay suspension arrangements, bulged bomb bay doors and fairings, was relatively straightforward, and 54 B.IVs were subsequently modified and distributed to squadrons of RAF Bomber Command\\'s Light Night Striking Force.   27 B Mk IVs were later converted for special operations with the Highball anti-shipping weapon, and were used by 618 Squadron, formed in April 1943 specifically to use this weapon.  A B Mk IV, DK290 was initially used as a trials aircraft for the bomb, followed by DZ471,530 and 533.  The B Mk IV had a maximum speed of 380\\xa0mph (611\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 265\\xa0mph (426\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 34,000\\xa0ft (10,360 m), a range of 2,040\\xa0nm (3,280\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,500\\xa0ft per minute (762 m). Other bomber variants of the Mosquito included the Merlin 21 powered B Mk V high-altitude version. Trials with this configuration were made with W4057 which had the wings strengthened and an addition of two fuel tanks, or alternatively two 500\\xa0lb (227\\xa0kg) bombs. This design was not produced in Britain, but formed the basic design of the Canadian-built B.VII. Only W4057 was built in prototype form. Jackson 2003, p. 16.  The Merlin 31 powered B Mk VII was built by de Havilland Canada. It was based on the B.V and first flown on 24 September 1942. It only saw service in Canada and only 25 were built. Six were handed over to the United States Army Air Forces.B Mk IX (54 built) was powered by the Merlin 72,73, 76 or 77. The two-stage Merlin variant was based on the PR.IX. The prototype DK 324 was converted from a PR.VIII and first flew on 24 March 1943. Jackson 2003, p. 17.  In October 1943 it was decided that all B Mk IVs and all B Mk IXs then in service would be converted to carry the 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookie\", and all B Mk IXs built after that date were designed to allow them to be converted to carry the weapon. Sharp and Bowyer 1971, p. 306  The B Mk IX had a maximum speed of 408\\xa0mph (656\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 250\\xa0mph (402\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 36,000\\xa0ft (10,970 m), a range of 2,450\\xa0nm (3,940\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,850 feet per minute (869 m). The IX could carry a maximum load of 2-4,000\\xa0lb (910-1,810\\xa0kg) of bombs.  A Mosquito B Mk IX holds the record for the most combat operations flown by an Allied bomber in the Second World War. LR503, known as \"F for Freddie\" (from its squadron code letters, GB*F), first served with No. 109 and subsequently, No. 105 RAF squadrons. It flew 213 sorties during the war, only to crash at Calgary airport during the Eighth Victory Loan Bond Drive on 10 May 1945, two days after Victory in Europe Day, killing both the pilot, Flt. Lt. Maurice Briggs, DSO, DFC, DFM and navigator Fl. Off. John Baker, DFC and Bar. The B Mk XVI was powered by the same variations as the B.IX. All B Mk XVIs were capable of being converted to carry the 4,000\\xa0lb (1,812\\xa0kg) \"Cookie\".  The two-stage powerplants were added along with a pressurised cabin. DZ540 first flew on 1 January 1944. The prototype was converted from a IV (402 built). The next variant, the B Mk XX, was powered by Packard Merlins 31 and 33s. It was the Canadian version of the IV. Altogether, 245 were built. The B.35 was powered by Merlin 113 and 114As. Some were converted to TT.35s (Target Tugs) and others were used as PR.35s (photo-reconnaissance).  The B Mk XVI had a maximum speed of 408\\xa0mph (656\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 245\\xa0mph (394\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 37,000\\xa0ft (11,280 m), a range of 1,485\\xa0nm (2,390\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,800\\xa0ft per minute (853 m). The type could carry 4,000\\xa0lb (1,810\\xa0kg) of bombs.  The B.35 had a maximum speed of 422\\xa0mph (679\\xa0km/h), a cruising speed of 276\\xa0mph (444\\xa0km/h), ceiling of 42,000\\xa0ft (12,800 m), a range of 1,750\\xa0nm (2,820\\xa0km), and a climb rate of 2,700\\xa0ft per minute (823 m). Bowman 2005, p. 26.  FightersDeveloped during 1940, the  first prototype of the Mosquito F Mk II  was completed on 15 May 1941. These Mosquitos were fitted with four 20\\xa0mm (.79\\xa0in) Hispano cannon in the fuselage belly and four .303\\xa0in (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns mounted in the nose. On production Mk IIs the machine guns and ammunition tanks were accessed via two centrally hinged, sideways opening doors in the upper nose section. To arm and service the cannon the bomb bay doors were replaced by manually operated bay doors: the F and NF Mk IIs could not carry bombs.  The type was also fitted with a gun camera in a compartment above the machine guns in the nose and was fitted with exhaust flame dampers to reduce the glare from the Merlin XXs. In August 1942 Britain experienced several incursions of high-altitude Luftwaffe bombers, including the Junkers Ju-86P. As a result of these raids, starting in September 1942, five Mosquito B Mk IV bombers were quickly converted into F Mk XV high-altitude, pressurised fighters, powered by two-stage Merlin 73s and 77s fitted with four-bladed propellers. The first of these conversions was MP469, which was wheeled into the experimental shop on 7 September and first flew on 14 September. The bomber nose forward of the cockpit was cut off and a standard fighter nose, complete with four .303 Brownings, grafted on in its place. The pressurised crew cabin retained the bomber\\'s canopy structure, with a vee-shaped, two-piece windscreen, while the bomber\\'s control wheel was replaced by the fighter\\'s control stick. Extended, pointed, wingtips increased the wingspan to  . The airframe was lightened by removing all armour plating, bullet-proofing from the fuel and oil tanks, and the outer wing and fuselage tanks (leaving the inner wing tanks with a total capacity of  ). Other ancillary equipment was also removed, and smaller-diameter main wheels were fitted after the first few flights. At a loaded weight of   the Mk XV was   lighter than a standard Mk II, and reached an altitude of  . Four more B Mk IVs were converted into F Mk XVs, and, in late 1942, were further modified to become NF MK XVs. All fighters and fighter bombers, apart from the F Mk XV, featured a modified canopy structure incorporating a flat, single piece armoured windscreen, and the crew entry/exit door was moved from the bottom of the forward fuselage to the right side of the nose, just forward of the wing leading edge.   The pilot was provided with a fighter-style control stick rather than a wheel. Night fighters At the end of 1940, the Air Staff\\'s preferred night fighter design was the Gloster F.18/40 (derived from their F.9/37). However, although in agreement as to the quality of the Gloster company\\'s design, the Ministry of Aircraft Production was concerned that Gloster would not be able to work on the F.18/40 and also the jet fighter design, considered the greater priority. Consequently in mid-1941 the Air Staff and MAP agreed that the Gloster aircraft would be dropped and the Mosquito considered for the night fighter requirement instead.  The first production night fighter Mosquitos were designated NF Mk II. A total of 466 were built with the first entering service with No. 157 Squadron in January 1942, replacing the Douglas Havoc. These aircraft were similar to the F Mk II, but were fitted with the AI Mk IV metric wavelength radar. The herring-bone transmitting antenna was mounted on the nose and the dipole receiving antennae were carried under the outer wings.  A number of NF IIs had their radar equipment removed and additional fuel tanks installed in the bay behind the cannon for use as night intruders. These aircraft, designated NF II (Special) were first used by 23 Squadron in operations over Europe in 1942.  23 Squadron was then deployed to Malta on 20 December 1942, and operated against targets in Italy. Ninety-seven NF Mk IIs were upgraded with centimetric AI Mk VIII radar and these were designated NF Mk XII. The NF Mk XIII, of which 270 were built, was the production equivalent of the Mk XII conversions. The centimetric radar sets were mounted in a solid \"thimble\" (Mk XII / XIII) or universal \"bull nose\" (Mk XVII / XIX) radome, which required the machine guns to be dispensed with. Four F Mk XVs were converted to the NF Mk XV. These were fitted with AI Mk VIII in a \"thimble\" radome, and the .303 Brownings were moved into a gun pack fitted under the forward fuselage.  NF Mk XVII was the designation for 99 NF Mk II conversions, with single-stage Merlin 21, 22, or 23 engines, but British AI.X (US SCR-720) radar.The NF Mk XIX was an improved version of the NF XIII. It could be fitted with American or British AI radars; 220 were built.The NF Mk 30 was the final wartime variant and was a high-altitude version, powered by two 1,710\\xa0hp (1,275\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 76s. The NF Mk 30 had a maximum speed of   at  .  It also carried early electronic countermeasures equipment. 526 were built. Other Mosquito night fighter variants which were planned for, but never built, included the NF Mk X and NF Mk XIV (the latter based on the NF Mk XIII), both of which were to have two-stage Merlins. The NF Mk 31 was a variant of the NF Mk 30, but powered by Packard Merlins. Mosquito night intruders of 100 Group, Bomber Command, were also fitted with a device called \"Serrate\" to allow them to track down German night fighters from their Lichtenstein B/C and SN-2 radar emissions, as well as a device named \"Perfectos\" that tracked German IFF signals.After the war, two more night fighter versions were developed: The NF Mk 36 was similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the American-built AI.Mk X radar. Powered by two 1,690\\xa0hp (1,260\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 113/114 piston engines; 266 built. Max level speeds (TAS) with flame dampers fitted were   at sea level,   at  , and   at  . The NF Mk 38, 101 of which were built, was also similar to the Mosquito NF Mk 30, but fitted with the British-built AI Mk IX radar. This variant suffered from stability problems and did not enter RAF service: 60 were eventually sold to Yugoslavia.  According to the Pilot\\'s Notes and Air Ministry \\'Special Flying Instruction TF/487\\', which posted limits on the Mosquito\\'s maximum speeds, the NF Mk 38 had a VNE of 370 knots (425\\xa0mph), without under-wing stores, and within the altitude range of sea level to  . However, from 10,000 to   the maximum speed was 348 knots (400\\xa0mph). As the height increased other recorded speeds were; 15,000 to   320 knots (368\\xa0mph); 20,000 to  , 295 knots (339\\xa0mph); 25,000 to  , 260 knots (299\\xa0mph); 30,000 to  , 235 knots (270\\xa0mph). With two added 100 gallon fuel tanks this performance fell; between sea level and 15,000 feet 330 knots (379\\xa0mph); between 15,000 to   320 knots (368\\xa0mph); 20,000 to  , 295 knots (339\\xa0mph); 25,000 to  , 260 knots (299\\xa0mph); 30,000 to  , 235 knots (270\\xa0mph). Little difference was noted above  .  Fighter-bombersThe FB Mk VI, which first flew on 1 June 1942, was powered by two 1,460\\xa0hp (1,088\\xa0kW) Merlin 21s or 1,635\\xa0hp (1,218\\xa0kW) Merlin 25s, and introduced a re-stressed and reinforced \"basic\" wing structure capable of carrying single 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) or 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bombs on racks housed in streamlined fairings under each wing, or up to eight RP-3 25lb or 60 lb rockets. In addition fuel lines were added to the wings to enable single   or   drop tanks to be carried under each wing.  Streetly 1981 p. 177.  The usual fixed armament was four 20mm Hispano Mk.II cannon and four .303 (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns, while two 250\\xa0lb (115\\xa0kg) or 500\\xa0lb (230\\xa0kg) bombs could be carried in the bomb bay. Unlike the F Mk II, the ventral bay doors were split into two pairs, with the forward pair being used to access the cannon, while the rear pair acted as bomb bay doors.  The maximum fuel load which could be carried was   distributed between   internal fuel tanks, plus two overload tanks, each of   capacity, which could be fitted in the bomb bay, and two   drop tanks.  All-out level speed is often given as  , however this speed applies to aircraft fitted with saxophone exhausts. The test aircraft (HJ679) fitted with stub exhausts was found to be performing below expectations. It was returned to de Havilland at Hatfield where it was serviced. Its top speed was then tested and found to be  , in line with expectations.  2,298 FB Mk VIs were built, nearly one-third of Mosquito production.  18 built by Airspeed Ltd were eventually modified to become FB.XVIIIs. Two were converted to TR.33 carrier-borne, maritime strike prototypes.  The FB Mk VI proved capable of holding its own with single-engine fighter aircraft in addition to bombing. For example, on 15 January 1945 Mosquito FB Mk VIs of 143 Squadron were engaged by 30 Focke-Wulf Fw 190s from Jagdgeschwader 5: nonetheless the Mosquitos sank an armed trawler and two merchant ships, losing five Mosquitos but shooting down five Fw 190s. Another fighter-bomber variant was the Mosquito FB Mk XVIII (sometimes known as the Tsetse) of which 18 were purpose-built and 27 converted from Mk VIs. The Mk XVIII was armed with a Molins \"6-pounder Class M\" cannon: this was a modified QF 6-pounder (57\\xa0mm) anti-tank gun fitted with an auto-loader to allow both semi- or fully automatic fire. 25 rounds were carried, with the entire installation weighing 1,580\\xa0lb (716\\xa0kg).   In addition, 900\\xa0lb (408\\xa0kg)of armour was added within the engine cowlings, around the nose and under the cockpit floor to protect the engines and crew from the heavily armed U-boats which were intended to be the primary target of the Mk XVIII.  Two or four .303 (7.7\\xa0mm) Browning machine guns were retained in the nose and were used to \"sight\" the main weapon onto the target.  The Air Ministry initially suspected that this variant would not work, but tests proved otherwise. Although the gun provided the Mosquito with yet more anti-shipping firepower for use against U-boats, it required a steady approach run to aim and fire the gun, making it vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.  The gun had a muzzle velocity of 2,950\\xa0ft/s (900\\xa0m/s)  and an excellent range of some 1,800 - 1,500 yards (1,650 - 1,370 m). It was sensitive to sidewards movement; an attack required a dive from 5,000\\xa0ft (1,520 m) at a 30° angle with the turn and bank indicator on centre. A move during the dive could jam the cannon.  The prototype HJ732 was converted from a FB.VI and was first flown on 8 June 1943. The effect of the new weapon was demonstrated on 10 March 1944 when Mk XVIIIs from 248 Squadron (escorted by four Mk VIs) engaged a German convoy of one U-boat and four destroyers, protected by 10 Ju 88s. Three of the Ju 88s were shot down. Pilot Tony Phillips destroyed one Ju 88 with four shells, one of which tore an engine off the Ju 88. The U-boat was damaged. On 25 March, U-976 was sunk by Molins-equipped Mosquitos.  On 10 June, U-821 was abandoned in the face of intense air attack from No. 248 Squadron, and was later sunk by a Liberator of No. 206 Squadron.  On 5 April 1945 Mosquitos with Molins attacked five German surface ships in the Kattegat and again demonstrated their value by setting them all on fire and sinking them. Bowman 2005, p. 115.   A German Sperrbrecher (pathfinder ship) was lost with all hands, with some 200 bodies being recovered by Swedish vessels.  Some 900 German soldiers died in total.  On 9 April German U-boats U-804, U-843 and U-1065 were spotted in formation heading for Norway. All were sunk.   U-251 and U-2359 followed on 19 April and 2 May 1945. Despite the preference for rockets, a further development of the large gun idea was carried out using the even larger 32-pounder, a gun based on the QF 3.7 inch AA gun designed for tank use, the airborne version using a novel form of muzzle brake. Developed to prove the feasibility of using such a large weapon in the Mosquito, this installation was not completed until after the war, when it was flown and fired in a single aircraft without problems, then scrapped.Designs based on the Mk VI were the FB Mk 26, built in Canada, and the FB Mk 40, built in Australia, powered by Packard Merlins. The FB.26 improved from the FB.21 using 1,620\\xa0hp (1,207\\xa0kW) single stage Packard Merlin 225s. Some 300 were built and another 37 converted to T.29 standard.  212 FB.40s were built by de Havilland Australia. Six were converted to PR.40; 28 to PR.41s one to FB.42 and 22 to T.43s tactical assault aircraft. Most were powered by Packard-built Merlin 31 or 33s.  TrainersThe Mosquito was also built as the Mosquito T Mk III two-seat trainer. This version, powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 21s, was unarmed and had a modified cockpit fitted with dual control arrangements. A total of 348 of the T Mk III were built for the RAF and Fleet Air Arm. de Havilland Australia built 11 T Mk 43 trainers, similar to the Mk III. Torpedo-bombersTo meet specification N.15/44 for a navalised Mosquito for Royal Navy use as a torpedo bomber, de Havilland produced a carrier-borne variant. A Mosquito FB.VI was modified as a prototype designated Sea Mosquito TR Mk 33 with folding wings, arrester hook, thimble nose radome, Merlin 25 engines with four-bladed propellers and a new oleo-pneumatic landing gear rather than the standard rubber-in-compression gear. An order for 100 TR.33s was placed although only 50 were built at Leavesden. Armament was four 20mm cannon, two 500\\xa0lb bombs in the bomb bay, (another two could be fitted under the wings) eight 60\\xa0lb rockets (four under each wing) and a standard torpedo under the fuselage. The first production TR.33 flew on 10 November 1945. This series was followed by six Sea Mosquito TR Mk 37s, which differed in having ASV Mk XIII radar instead of the TR.33\\'s AN/APS-6. Target tugsThe Royal Navy also operated the Mosquito TT Mk 39 for target towing. A number of B Mk XVIs bombers were converted into TT Mk 39 target tug aircraft. The RAF\\'s target tug version was the Mosquito TT Mk 35 which were the last aircraft to remain in operational service, finally being retired in 1956. Two ex-RAF FB.6s were converted to TT.6 standard at Manchester (Ringway) Airport by Fairey Aviation in 1953–1954, being delivered to the Belgian Air Force for use as towing aircraft from the Sylt firing ranges. Canadian-built A total of 1,133  (to 1945) Mosquitos were built by De Havilland Canada at Downsview Airfield in Downsview Ontario (now Downsview Park in Toronto Ontario). Mosquito B Mk VII : Canadian version based on the Mosquito B Mk V bomber aircraft. Powered by two 1,418\\xa0hp (1,057\\xa0kW) Packard Merlin 31 piston engines; 25 built. Mosquito B Mk XX : Canadian version of the Mosquito B Mk IV bomber aircraft; 145 built, of which 40 were converted into F-8 photo-reconnaissance aircraft for the USAAF.

Powered by two 1,460\\xa0hp (1,089\\xa0kW) Roll-Royce Merlin 31 piston engines. A total of 178 built in Australia. Mosquito PR Mk 40 : This designation was given to six FB Mk 40s, which were converted into photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Mosquito FB Mk 41 : Two-seat fighter-bomber version for the RAAF. A total of 11 were built in Australia. Mosquito PR Mk 41 : Two-seat photo-survey version for the RAAF. A total of 17 were built in Australia. Mosquito FB Mk 42 : Two-seat fighter-bomber version. Powered by two Rolls-Royce Merlin 69 piston engines. One FB Mk 40 aircraft was converted into a Mosquito FB Mk 42. Mosquito T Mk 43 : Two-seat training version for the RAAF. A total of 11 FB Mk 40s were converted into Mosquito T Mk 43s. HighballA number of Mosquito IVs were modified by Vickers-Armstrongs to carry Highball \"bouncing bombs\" and were allocated Vickers Type numbers: Type 463 - Prototype Highball conversion of Mosquito IV DZ741. Type 465 - Conversion of 33 Mosquito IVs to carry Highball. Production DetailsIn England, fuselage shells were mainly made by the furniture companies Ronson, E. Gomme, Parker Knoll and Styles & Mealing. The specialized wood veneer used in the construction of the Mosquito was made by Roddis Manufacturing in Marshfield, Wisconsin, United States. Hamilton Roddis had teams of dextrous young women ironing the (unusually thin) strong wood veneer before shipping to the UK. Cole 2001   Wing spars were made by J.B. Heath and Dancer & Hearne. Many of the other parts, including flaps, flap shrouds, fins, leading edge assemblies and bomb doors were also produced in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, which was well suited to these tasks because of a well-established furniture manufacturing industry. Dancer & Hearne processed much of the wood from start to finish, receiving timber and transforming it into finished wing spars at their High Wycombe factory.About 5,000 of the 7,781 Mosquitos made contained parts made in High Wycombe.  In Canada, fuselages were built in the Oshawa, Ontario plant of General Motors of Canada Limited. These were shipped to De Havilland Canada in Toronto for mating to fuselages and completion. As a secondary manufacturer, de Havilland Australia started construction in Sydney. These production lines added 1,076 from Canada and 212 from Australia.Total Mosquito production was 7,781 of which 6,710 were built during the war. The ferry operation of the Mosquito from Canada to the war front was problematic, as a small fraction of the aircraft mysteriously disappeared over mid-Atlantic. The theory of \"auto-explosion\" was offered, and, although a concentrated effort at de Havilland Canada to address production problems with engine and oil systems reduced the number of aircraft lost, the actual cause of the losses was not known. The company introduced an additional five hours flight testing to \"clear\" production aircraft before the ferry flight. By the end of the war, nearly 500 Mosquito bombers and fighter-bombers had been delivered successfully by the Canadian operation. In total, both during the war and after, de Havilland exported 46 FB.VIs and 29 PR.XVIs to Australia, two FB.VI and 18 NF.30s to Belgium, approximately 205 FB.26, T.29 and T.27s to Nationalist China, 19 FB.VIs to Czechoslovakia in 1948, 6 FB.VIs to Dominica, a few B.IVs, 57 FB.VIs, 29 PR.XVIs and 23 NF.XXXs to France. Some T.IIIs were exported to Israel along with 60 FB.VIs, and at least five PR.XVIs and 14 naval versions. Four T.IIIs, 76 FB.VIs, one FB.40 and four T.43s were exported to New Zealand. Three T.IIIs were exported to Norway, and 18 FB.VIs which were later converted to night fighter standard. South Africa received two F.II and 14 PR.XVI/XIs and Sweden received 46 NF.XIXs. Turkey received 96 FB.VIs and several T.IIIs, and Yugoslavia had 60 NF.38s, 80 FB.VIs and three T.IIIs delivered.

The largest collection of Mosquitos is at the de Havilland Aircraft Heritage Centre in the United Kingdom, which owns three aircraft, including the first prototype, W4050, potentially the only initial prototype of a World War 2 aircraft design still in existence in the 21st century.The Mosquito in flying condition, Mosquito FB.26 KA114, was built in Canada in 1945, was restored by Avspecs Limited of Ardmore, New Zealand; its first post-restoration flight was on 27 September 2012. The third, fourth, fifth and sixth flights were watched by several thousand spectators at a special air show at Ardmore on 29 September. The aircraft is owned by Jerry Yagen and is due to be moved its new home at the Military Aviation Museum, a large collection of flying historic aircraft in Virginia Beach, Virginia. A complete set of forms, jigs and moulds will allow for new Mosquitos to be built. Sixteen years earlier, in July 1996, the then-only airworthy Mosquito, RR299, G-ASKH, was destroyed in an airshow accident at Barton, Manchester; both aircrew were killed. A temporary loss of power in the left engine caused the pilot (with over 10,000 hours of flying experience) to lose control at low level; RR299 hit the ground at high speed in nearby woodland and disintegrated.

Rise of Dost Mohammad Khan  After the decline of the Durrani dynasty in 1823, Dost Mohammad Khan established the Barakzai dynasty after becoming the next Emir of Afghanistan. It was not until 1826 that the energetic Dost Mohammad Khan was able to exert sufficient control over his brothers to take over the throne in Kabul, where he proclaimed himself the Shah. Dost Mohammad achieved prominence among his brothers through clever use of the support of his mother\\'s Qizilbash tribesmen and his own youthful apprenticeship under his brother, Fateh Khan. Among the many problems he faced was repelling Sikh encroachment on the Pashtun areas east of the Khyber Pass. After working assiduously to establish control and stability in his domains around Kabul, the Shah next chose to confront the warring Sikhs.In 1834 Dost Mohammad defeated an invasion by the former ruler, Shuja Shah Durrani, but his absence from Kabul gave the Sikhs the opportunity to expand westward. Ranjit Singh\\'s forces occupied Peshawar, moving from there into territory ruled directly by Kabul. In 1836 Dost Mohammad\\'s forces, under the command of his son Akbar Khan, defeated the Sikhs at the Battle of Jamrud, a post fifteen kilometres west of Peshawar. This was a pyrrhic victory and they failed to fully dislodge the Sikhs from Jamrud. The Afghan leader did not follow up this triumph by retaking Peshawar, however, but instead contacted Lord Auckland, the new British governor general in British India, for help in dealing with the Sikhs. With this letter, Dost Mohammad formally set the stage for British intervention in Afghanistan. At the heart of the Great Game lay the willingness of Britain and Russia to subdue, subvert, or subjugate the small independent states that lay between Russia and British India. The Great Game  The British became the major power in the Indian sub-continent after the Treaty of Paris (1763) and began to show interest in Afghanistan as early as their 1809 treaty with Shuja Shah Durrani. It was the threat of the expanding Russian Empire beginning to push for an advantage in the Afghanistan region that placed pressure on British India, in what became known as the \"Great Game\". The Great Game set in motion the confrontation of the British and Russian empires, whose spheres of influence moved steadily closer to one another until they met in Afghanistan. It also involved Britain\\'s repeated attempts to impose a puppet government in Kabul. The remainder of the 19th century saw greater European involvement in Afghanistan and her surrounding territories and heightened conflict among the ambitious local rulers as Afghanistan\\'s fate played out globally. The débâcle of the Afghan civil war left a vacuum in the Hindu Kush area that concerned the British, who were well aware of the many times in history it had been employed as the invasion route to South Asia. In the early decades of the 19th century, it became clear to the British that the major threat to their interests in India would not come from the fragmented Afghan empire, the Iranians, or the French, but from the Russians, who had already begun a steady advance southward from the Caucasus.At the same time, the Russians feared permanent British occupation in Central Asia as the British encroached northward, taking the Punjab, Sindh, and Kashmir; later to become Pakistan. The British viewed Russia\\'s absorption of the Caucasus, the Kyrgyz and Turkmen lands, the Khanate of Khiva, and the Emirate of Bukhara with equal suspicion as a threat to their interests in the Asian subcontinent.  In addition to this rivalry between Britain and Russia, there were two specific reasons for British concern over Russia\\'s intentions. First was the Russian influence at the Iranian court, which prompted the Russians to support Iran in its attempt to take Herat, historically the western gateway to Afghanistan and northern India. In 1837 Iran advanced on Herat with the support and advice of Russian officers. The second immediate reason was the presence in Kabul in 1837 of a Russian agent, Yan Vitkevich, who was ostensibly there, as was the British agent Alexander Burnes, for commercial discussions.The British demanded that Dost Mohammad sever all contact with the Iranians and Russians, remove Vitkevich from Kabul, surrender all claims to Peshawar, and respect Peshawar\\'s independence as well as that of Kandahar, which was under the control of his brothers at the time. In return, the British government intimated that it would ask Ranjit Singh to reconcile with the Afghans. When Auckland refused to put the agreement in writing, Dost Mohammad turned his back on the British and began negotiations with Vitkevich.In 1838 Auckland, Ranjit Singh, and Shuja signed an agreement stating that Shuja would regain control of Kabul and Kandahar with the help of the British and Sikhs; he would accept Sikh rule of the former Afghan provinces already controlled by Ranjit Singh, and that Herat would remain independent. In practice, the plan replaced Dost Mohammad with a British figurehead whose autonomy would be as limited as that of other Indian princes.It soon became apparent to the British that Sikh participation, advancing toward Kabul through the Khyber Pass while Shuja and the British advanced through Kandahar, would not be forthcoming. Auckland\\'s plan in the spring of 1838 was for the Sikhs to place Shuja on the Afghan throne, with British support. By the end of the summer however, the plan had changed; now the British alone would impose the pliant Shuja Shah. First Anglo-Afghan War, 1838-1842  To justify his plan, the Governor-General of India Lord Auckland issued the Simla Manifesto in October 1838, setting forth the necessary reasons for British intervention in Afghanistan. The manifesto stated that in order to ensure the welfare of India, the British must have a trustworthy ally on India\\'s western frontier. The British pretense that their troops were merely supporting Shah Shujah\\'s small army in retaking what was once his throne fooled no one. Although the Simla Manifesto stated that British troops would be withdrawn as soon as Shuja was installed in Kabul, Shuja\\'s rule depended entirely on British arms to suppress rebellion and on British funds to buy the support of tribal chiefs. The British denied that they were invading Afghanistan, instead claiming they were merely supporting its legitimate Shuja government \"against foreign interference and factious opposition\". In November 1841 insurrection and massacre flared up in Kabul. The British vacillated and disagreed and were beleaguered in their inadequate cantonments. The British negotiated with the most influential sirdars, cut off as they were by winter and insurgent tribes from any hope of relief. Muhammad Akbar Khan, son of the captive Dost Muhammad, arrived in Kabul and became effective leader of the sirdars. At a conference with them Sir William MacNaghten was killed, but in spite of this, the sirdars\\' demands were agreed to by the British and they withdrew. During the withdrawal they were attacked by Ghilzai tribesmen and in running battles through the snowbound passes nearly the entire column of 4,500 troops and 12,000 camp followers were killed. Of the British only one, Dr. William Brydon, reached Jalalabad, while a few others were captured.Afghan forces loyal to Akbar Khan besieged the remaining British contingents at Kandahar, Ghazni and Jalalabad. Ghazni fell, but the other garrisons held out, and with the help of reinforcements from India their besiegers were defeated. While preparations were under way for a renewed advance on Kabul, the new Governor-General Lord Ellenborough ordered British forces to leave Afghanistan after securing the release of the prisoners from Kabul and taking reprisals. The forces from Kandahar and Jalalabad again defeated Akbar Khan, retook Ghazni and Kabul, inflicted widespread devastation and rescued the prisoners before withdrawing through the Khyber Pass. Mid-nineteenth centuryAfter months of chaos in Kabul, Mohammad Akbar Khan secured local control and in April 1843 his father Dost Mohammad, who had been released by the British, returned to the throne in Afghanistan. In the following decade, Dost Mohammad concentrated his efforts on reconquering Mazari Sharif, Konduz, Badakhshan, and Kandahar. Mohammad Akbar Khan died in 1845. During the Second Anglo-Sikh War (1848–49), Dost Mohammad\\'s last effort to take Peshawar failed.By 1854 the British wanted to resume relations with Dost Mohammad, whom they had essentially ignored in the intervening twelve years. The 1855 Treaty of Peshawar reopened diplomatic relations, proclaimed respect for each side\\'s territorial integrity, and pledged both sides as friends of each other\\'s friends and enemies of each other\\'s enemies.In 1857 an addendum to the 1855 treaty permitted a British military mission to become a presence in Kandahar (but not Kabul) during a conflict with the Persians, who had attacked Herat in 1856. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, some British officials suggested restoring Peshawar to Dost Mohammad, in return for his support against the rebellious sepoys of the Bengal Army, but this view was rejected by British political officers on the North West frontier, who believed that Dost Mohammad would see this as a sign of weakness and turn against the British. In 1863 Dost Mohammad retook Herat with British acquiescence. A few months later, he died. Sher Ali Khan, his third son, and proclaimed successor, failed to recapture Kabul from his older brother, Mohammad Afzal (whose troops were led by his son, Abdur Rahman) until 1868, after which Abdur Rahman retreated across the Amu Darya and bided his time.In the years immediately following the First Anglo-Afghan War, and especially after the Indian rebellion of 1857 against the British in India, Liberal Party governments in London took a political view of Afghanistan as a buffer state. By the time Sher Ali had established control in Kabul in 1868, he found the British ready to support his regime with arms and funds, but nothing more. Over the next ten years, relations between the Afghan ruler and Britain deteriorated steadily. The Afghan ruler was worried about the southward encroachment of Russia, which by 1873 had taken over the lands of the khan, or ruler, of Khiva. Sher Ali sent an envoy seeking British advice and support. The previous year the British had signed an agreement with the Russians in which the latter agreed to respect the northern boundaries of Afghanistan and to view the territories of the Afghan amir as outside their sphere of influence. The British, however, refused to give any assurances to the disappointed Sher Ali. Second Anglo-Afghan War, 1878-1880  After tension between Russia and Britain in Europe ended with the June 1878 Congress of Berlin, Russia turned its attention to Central Asia. That same summer, Russia sent an uninvited diplomatic mission to Kabul. Sher Ali tried, but failed, to keep them out. Russian envoys arrived in Kabul on 22 July 1878 and on 14 August, the British demanded that Sher Ali accept a British mission too. The amir not only refused to receive a British mission but threatened to stop it if it were dispatched. Lord Lytton, the viceroy, ordered a diplomatic mission to set out for Kabul in September 1878 but the mission was turned back as it approached the eastern entrance of the Khyber Pass, triggering the Second Anglo-Afghan War. A British force of about 40,000 fighting men was distributed into military columns which penetrated Afghanistan at three different points. An alarmed Sher Ali attempted to appeal in person to the tsar for assistance, but unable to do so, he returned to Mazari Sharif, where he died on 21 February 1879. With British forces occupying much of the country, Sher Ali\\'s son and successor, Mohammad Yaqub Khan, signed the Treaty of Gandamak in May 1879 to prevent a British invasion of the rest of the country. According to this agreement and in return for an annual subsidy and vague assurances of assistance in case of foreign aggression, Yaqub relinquished control of Afghan foreign affairs to the British. British representatives were installed in Kabul and other locations, British control was extended to the Khyber and Michni passes, and Afghanistan ceded various frontier areas and Quetta to Britain. The British army then withdrew. Soon afterwards, an uprising in Kabul led to the slaughter of Britain\\'s Resident in Kabul, Sir Pierre Cavagnari and his guards and staff on 3 September 1879, provoking the second phase of the Second Afghan War. Major General Sir Frederick Roberts led the Kabul Field Force over the Shutargardan Pass into central Afghanistan, defeated the Afghan Army at Char Asiab on 6 October 1879 and occupied Kabul. Ghazi Mohammad Jan Khan Wardak staged an uprising and attacked British forces near Kabul in the Siege of the Sherpur Cantonment in December 1879, but his defeat there resulted in the collapse of this rebellion.  Yaqub Khan, suspected of complicity in the massacre of Cavagnari and his staff, was obliged to abdicate. The British considered a number of possible political settlements, including partitioning Afghanistan between multiple rulers or placing Yaqub\\'s brother Ayub Khan on the throne, but ultimately decided to install his cousin Abdur Rahman Khan as emir instead. Ayub Khan, who had been serving as governor of Herat, rose in revolt, defeated a British detachment at the Battle of Maiwand in July 1880 and besieged Kandahar. Roberts then led the main British force from Kabul and decisively defeated Ayub Khan in September at the Battle of Kandahar, bringing his rebellion to an end. Abdur Rahman had confirmed the Treaty of Gandamak, leaving the British in control of the territories ceded by Yaqub Khan and ensuring British control of Afghanistan\\'s foreign policy in exchange for protection and a subsidy. Abandoning the provocative policy of maintaining a British resident in Kabul, but having achieved all their other objectives, the British withdrew. The Iron Amir, 1880-1901 As far as British interests were concerned, Abdur Rahman answered their prayers: a forceful, intelligent leader capable of welding his divided people into a state; and he was willing to accept limitations to his power imposed by British control of his country\\'s foreign affairs and the British buffer state policy. His twenty-one-year reign was marked by efforts to modernize and establish control of the kingdom, whose boundaries were delineated by the two empires bordering it. Abdur Rahman turned his considerable energies to what evolved into the creation of the modern state of Afghanistan.He achieved this consolidation of Afghanistan in three ways. He suppressed various rebellions and followed up his victories with harsh punishment, execution, and deportation. He broke the stronghold of Pashtun tribes by forcibly transplanting them. He transplanted his most powerful Pashtun enemies, the Ghilzai, and other tribes from southern and south-central Afghanistan to areas north of the Hindu Kush with predominantly non-Pashtun populations. The last non-Muslim Afghans of Kafiristan north of Kabul were forcefully converted to Islam. Finally, he created a system of provincial governorates different from old tribal boundaries. Provincial governors had a great deal of power in local matters, and an army was placed at their disposal to enforce tax collection and suppress dissent. Abdur Rahman kept a close eye on these governors, however, by creating an effective intelligence system. During his reign, tribal organization began to erode as provincial government officials allowed land to change hands outside the traditional clan and tribal limits.In addition to forging a nation from the splintered regions comprising Afghanistan, Abdur Rahman tried to modernize his kingdom by forging a regular army and the first institutionalized bureaucracy. Despite his distinctly authoritarian personality, Abdur Rahman called for a loya jirga, an assemblage of royal princes, important notables, and religious leaders. According to his autobiography, Abdur Rahman had three goals: subjugating the tribes, extending government control through a strong, visible army, and reinforcing the power of the ruler and the royal family. During his visit to Rawalpindi in 1885, the Amir requested the Viceroy of India to depute a Muslim Envoy to Kabul having noble birth and of ruling family background. Mirza Atta Ullah Khan, Sardar Bahadur s/o Khan Bahadur Mirza Fakir Ullah Khan (Saman Burj Wazirabad), a direct descendent of Jarral Rajput Rajas of Rajauri was selected and approved by the Amir to be the British Envoy to Kabul.Abdur Rahman also paid attention to technological advancement. He brought foreign physicians, engineers (especially for mining), geologists, and printers to Afghanistan. He imported European machinery and encouraged the establishment of small factories to manufacture soap, candles, and leather goods. He sought European technical advice on communications, transport, and irrigation. Local Afghan tribes strongly resisted this modernization. Workmen making roads had to be protected by the army against local warriors. Nonetheless, despite these sweeping internal policies, Abdur Rahman\\'s foreign policy was completely in foreign hands.The first important frontier dispute was the Panjdeh crisis of 1885, precipitated by Russian encroachment into Central Asia. Having seized the Merv (now Mary) Oasis by 1884, Russian forces were directly adjacent to Afghanistan. Claims to the Panjdeh Oasis were in debate, with the Russians keen to take over all the region\\'s Turkoman domains. After battling Afghan forces in the spring of 1885, the Russians seized the oasis. Russian and British troops were quickly alerted, but the two powers reached a compromise; Russia was in possession of the oasis, and Britain believed it could keep the Russians from advancing any farther. Without an Afghan say in the matter, the Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed the Russians would relinquish the farthest territory captured in their advance but retain Panjdeh. This agreement on these border sections delineated for Afghanistan a permanent northern frontier at the Amu Darya but also the loss of much territory, especially around Panjdeh.The second section of Afghan border demarcated during Abdur Rahman\\'s reign was in the Wakhan. The British insisted Abdur Rahman accept sovereignty over this remote region where unruly Kyrgyz held sway, he had no choice but to accept Britain\\'s compromise. In 1895 and 1896 another Joint Anglo-Russian Boundary Commission agreed on the frontier boundary to the far northeast of Afghanistan, which bordered Chinese territory (although the Chinese did not formally accept this as a boundary between the two countries until 1964.)For Abdur Rahman, delineating the boundary with India (through the Pashtun area) was far more significant, and it was during his reign that the Durand Line was drawn. Under pressure, Abdur Rahman agreed in 1893 to accept a mission headed by the British Indian foreign secretary, Sir Mortimer Durand, to define the limits of British and Afghan control in the Pashtun territories. Boundary limits were agreed on by Durand and Abdur Rahman before the end of 1893, but there is some question about the degree to which Abdur Rahman willingly ceded certain regions. There were indications that he regarded the Durand Line as a delimitation of separate areas of political responsibility, not a permanent international frontier, and that he did not explicitly cede control over certain parts (such as Kurram and Chitral) that were already in British control under the Treaty of Gandamak.The Durand Line cut through tribes and bore little relation to the realities of demography or military strategy. The line laid the foundation not for peace between the border regions, but for heated disagreement between the governments of Afghanistan and British India, and later, Afghanistan and Pakistan over what came to be known as the issue of Pashtunistan or \\'Land of the Pashtuns\\'. (See Siege of Malakand).The clearest manifestation that Abdur Rahman had established control in Afghanistan was the peaceful succession of his eldest son, Habibullah Khan, to the throne on his father\\'s death in October 1901. Although Abdur Rahman had fathered many children, he groomed Habibullah to succeed him, and he made it difficult for his other sons to contest the succession by keeping power from them and sequestering them in Kabul under his control. Habibullah Khan, 1901–1919 Habibullah Khan, Abdur Rahman Khan\\'s eldest son and child of a slave mother, kept a close watch on the palace intrigues revolving around his father\\'s more distinguished wife (a granddaughter of Dost Mohammad), who sought the throne for her own son. Although made secure in his position as ruler by virtue of support from the army which was created by his father, Habibullah was not as domineering as Abdur Rahman. Consequently, the influence of religious leaders as well as that of Mahmud Tarzi, a cousin of the king, increased during his reign.  Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet and journalist, founded an Afghan nationalist newspaper with Habibullah\\'s agreement, and until 1919 he used the newspaper as a platform for rebutting clerical criticism of Western-influenced changes in government and society, for espousing full Afghan independence, and for other reforms. Tarzi\\'s passionate Afghan nationalism influenced a future generation of Asian reformers.The boundary with Iran was firmly delineated in 1904, replacing the ambiguous line made by a British commission in 1872. Agreement could not be reached, however, on sharing the waters of the Helmand River.Like all foreign policy developments of this period affecting Afghanistan, the conclusion of the \"Great Game\" between Russia and Britain occurred without the Afghan ruler\\'s participation. The 1907 Anglo-Russian Entente (the Convention of St. Petersburg) not only divided the region into separate areas of Russian and British influence but also established foundations for Afghan neutrality. The convention provided for Russian acquiescence that Afghanistan was now outside this sphere of influence, and for Russia to consult directly with Britain on matters relating to Russian-Afghan relations. Britain, for its part, would not occupy or annex Afghan territory, or interfere in Afghanistan\\'s internal affairs.During World War I, Afghanistan remained neutral despite pressure to support Turkey when its sultan proclaimed his nation\\'s participation in what it considered a holy war. Habibullah did, however, entertain an Indo-German-Turkish mission in Kabul in 1915 that had as its titular head the Indian nationalist Mahendra Pratap and was led by Oskar Niedermayer and the German legate Werner Otto von Hentig. After much procrastination, he won an agreement from the Central Powers for a huge payment and arms provision in exchange for attacking British India. But the crafty Afghan ruler clearly viewed the war as an opportunity to play one side off against the other, for he also offered the British to resist a Central Powers attack on India in exchange for an end to British control of Afghan foreign policy.== Third Anglo-Afghan War and Independence ==   Amanullah\\'s ten years of reign initiated a period of dramatic change in Afghanistan in both foreign and domestic politics. Amanullah declared full independence and sparked the Third Anglo-Afghan War. Amanullah altered foreign policy in his new relations with external powers and transformed domestic politics with his social, political, and economic reforms. Although his reign ended abruptly, he achieved some notable successes, and his efforts failed as much due to the centrifugal forces of tribal Afghanistan and the machinations of Russia and Britain as to any political folly on his part.Amanullah came to power just as the entente between Russia and Britain broke down following the Russian Revolution of 1917. Once again Afghanistan provided a stage on which the great powers played out their schemes against one another. Keen to modernise his country and free it from foreign domination, Amanullah, sought to shore up his powerbase. Amidst intrigue in the Afghan court, and political and civil unrest in India, he sought to divert attention from the internal divisions of Afghanistan and unite all faction behind him by attacking the British. Using the civil unrest in India as an excuse to move troops to the Durand Line, Afghan troops crossed the border at the western end of the Khyber Pass on 3 May 1919 and occupied the village of Bagh, the scene of an earlier uprising in April. Wilkinson-Latham & McBride, p. 23  In response, the Indian government ordered a full mobilisation and on 6 May 1919 declared war. For the British it had come at a time when they were still recovering from the First World War. The troops that were stationed in India were mainly reserves and Territorials, who were awaiting demobilisation and keen to return to Britain, whilst the few regular regiments that were available were tired and depleted from five years of fighting. Afghan forces achieved success in the initial days of the war, taking the British and Indians by surprise in two main thrusts as the Afghan regular army was joined by large numbers of Pashtun tribesmen from both sides of the border. A series of skirmishes then followed as the British and Indians recovered from their initial surprise. As a counterbalance to deficiencies in manpower and morale, the British had a considerable advantage in terms of equipment, possessing machine guns, armoured cars, motor transport, wireless communications and aircraft and it was the latter that would prove decisive. British forces used airpower to shock the Afghans, and the King\\'s home was directly attacked in what is the first case of aerial bombardment in Afghanistan\\'s history. The attacks played a key role in forcing an armistice but brought an angry rebuke from King Amanullah. He wrote: \"It is a matter of great regret that the throwing of bombs by zeppelins on London was denounced as a most savage act and the bombardment of places of worship and sacred spots was considered a most abominable operation. While we now see with our own eyes that such operations were a habit which is prevalent among all civilized people of the west\" The fighting concluded in August 1919 and Britain virtually dictated the terms of the Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919, a temporary armistice that provided, on one somewhat ambiguous interpretation, for Afghan self-determination in foreign affairs.  Before final negotiations were concluded in 1921, however, Afghanistan had already begun to establish its own foreign policy without repercussions anyway, including diplomatic relations with the new government in the Soviet Union in 1919. During the 1920s, Afghanistan established diplomatic relations with most major countries. Amanullah Khan, 1919–1929  On 20 February 1919, Habibullah Khan was assassinated on a hunting trip. He had not declared a succession, but left his third son, Amanullah Khan, in charge in Kabul. Amanullah did have an older brother, Nasrullah Khan.  But, because Amanullah controlled both the national treasury and the army, Amanullah was well situated to seize power. The army\\'s support allowed Amanullah to suppress other claims and imprison those relatives who would not swear loyalty to him. Within a few months, the new amir had gained the allegiance of most tribal leaders and established control over the cities. Amanullah Khan\\'s reforms were heavily influenced by Europe. This came through the influence of Mahmud Tarzi, who was both Amanullah Khan\\'s father-in-law and Foreign Minister. Mahmud Tarzi, a highly educated, well-traveled poet, journalist, and diplomat, was a key figure that brought Western dress and etiquette to Afghanistan. He also fought for progressive reforms such as woman\\'s rights, educational rights, and freedom of press. All of these influences, brought by Tarzi and others, were welcomed by Amanullah Khan.In 1926, Amanullah ended the Emirate of Afghanistan and proclaimed the Kingdom of Afghanistan with himself as king. In 1927 and 1928, King Amanullah Khan and his wife Soraya Tarzi visited Europe. On this trip they were honored and feted. In fact, in 1928 the King and Queen of Afghanistan received honorary degrees from Oxford University. This was an era when other Muslim nations, like Turkey and Egypt were also on the path to modernization. King Amanullah was so impressed with the social progress of Europe that he tried to implement them right away, this met with heavy resistance from the conservative sect and eventually lead to his demise.Amanullah enjoyed early popularity within Afghanistan and he used his power to modernize the country. Amanullah created new cosmopolitan schools for both boys and girls in the region and overturned centuries-old traditions such as strict dress codes for women. He created a new capital city and increased trade with Europe and Asia. He also advanced a modernist constitution that incorporated equal rights and individual freedoms. This rapid modernization though, created a backlash, and a reactionary uprising known as the Khost rebellion which was suppressed in 1924.After Amanullah travelled to Europe in late 1927, opposition to his rule increased. An uprising in Jalalabad culminated in a march to the capital, and much of the army deserted rather than resist.  On 14 January 1929, Amanullah abdicated in favor of his brother, King Inayatullah Khan.  On 17 January, Inayatullah abdicated and Habibullah Kalakani became the next ruler of Afghanistan and restored the emirate. However, his rule was short lived and, on 17 October 1929, Habibullah Kalakani was overthrown and replaced by King Nadir Khan.After his abdication in 1929, Amanullah went into temporary exile in India.  When he attempted to return to Afghanistan, he had little support from the people. From India, the ex-king traveled to Europe and settled in Italy, and later in Switzerland. Meanwhile, Nadir Khan made sure his return to Afghanistan was impossible by engaging in a propaganda war. Nadir Khan accused Amanullah Khan of kufr with his pro western policies. Mohammed Zahir Shah, 1933–1973  In 1933, after the assassination of Nadir Khan, Mohammed Zahir Shah became king.

Classically, chemical reactions encompass changes that only involve the positions of electrons in the forming and breaking of chemical bonds between atoms, with no change to the nuclei (no change to the elements present), and can often be described by a chemical equation. Nuclear chemistry is a sub-discipline of chemistry that involves the chemical reactions of unstable and radioactive elements where both electronic and nuclear changes may both occur.The substance (or substances) initially involved in a chemical reaction are called reactants or reagents. Chemical reactions are usually characterized by a chemical change, and they yield one or more products, which usually have properties different from the reactants. Reactions often consist of a sequence of individual sub-steps, the so-called elementary reactions, and the information on the precise course of action is part of the reaction mechanism. Chemical reactions are described with chemical equations, which graphically present the starting materials, end products, and sometimes intermediate products and reaction conditions.Chemical reactions happen at a characteristic reaction rate at a given temperature and chemical concentration, and rapid  reactions are often described as spontaneous, requiring no input of extra energy other than thermal energy. Non-spontaneous reactions run so slowly that they are considered to require the input of some type of additional energy (such as extra heat, light or electricity) in order to proceed to completion (chemical equilibrium) at human time scales.Different chemical reactions are used in combinations during chemical synthesis in order to obtain a desired product. In biochemistry, a similar series of chemical reactions form metabolic pathways. These reactions are often catalyzed by protein enzymes. These enzymes increase the rates of biochemical reactions, so that metabolic syntheses and decompositions impossible under ordinary conditions may be performed at the temperatures and concentrations present within a cell.The general concept of a chemical reaction has been extended to non-chemical reactions between entities smaller than atoms, including nuclear reactions, radioactive decays, and reactions between elementary particles as described by quantum field theory. HistoryChemical reactions such as combustion in the fire, fermentation and the reduction of ores to metals were known since antiquity. Initial theories of transformation of materials were developed by Greek philosophers, such as the Four-Element Theory of Empedocles stating that any substance is composed of the four basic elements – fire, water, air and earth. In the Middle Ages, chemical transformations were studied by Alchemists. They attempted, in particular, to convert lead into gold, for which purpose they used reactions of lead and lead-copper alloys with sulfur. The production of chemical substances that do not normally occur in nature has long been tried, such as the synthesis of sulfuric and nitric acids attributed to the controversial alchemist Jābir ibn Hayyān. The process involved heating of sulfate and nitrate minerals such as copper sulfate, alum and saltpeter. In the 17th century, Johann Rudolph Glauber produced hydrochloric acid and sodium sulfate by reacting sulfuric acid and sodium chloride. With the development of the lead chamber process in 1746 and the Leblanc process, allowing large-scale production of sulfuric acid and sodium carbonate, respectively, chemical reactions became implemented into the industry. Further optimization of sulfuric acid technology resulted in the contact process in 1880s,  and the Haber process  was developed in 1909–1910 for ammonia synthesis. From the 16th century, researchers including Jan Baptist van Helmont, Robert Boyle and Isaac Newton tried to establish theories of the experimentally observed chemical transformations. The phlogiston theory was proposed in 1667 by Johann Joachim Becher. It postulated the existence of a fire-like element called \"phlogiston\", which was contained within combustible bodies and released during combustion. This proved to be false in 1785 by Antoine Lavoisier who found the correct explanation of the combustion as reaction with oxygen from the air. Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac recognized in 1808 that gases always react in a certain relationship with each other. Based on this idea and the atomic theory of John Dalton, Joseph Proust had developed the law of definite proportions, which later resulted in the concepts of stoichiometry and chemical equations. Regarding the organic chemistry, it was long believed that compounds obtained from living organisms were too complex to be obtained synthetically. According to the concept of vitalism, organic matter was endowed with a \"vital force\" and distinguished from inorganic materials. This separation was ended however by the synthesis of urea from inorganic precursors by Friedrich Wöhler in 1828. Other chemists who brought major contributions to organic chemistry include Alexander William Williamson with his synthesis of ethers and Christopher Kelk Ingold, who, among many discoveries, established the mechanisms of substitution reactions. EquationsChemical equations are used to graphically illustrate chemical reactions. They consist of chemical or structural formulas of the reactants on the left and those of the products on the right. They are separated by an arrow (→) which indicates the direction and type of the reaction; the arrow is read as the word \"yields\".  The tip of the arrow points in the direction in which the reaction proceeds. A double arrow ( ) pointing in opposite directions is used for equilibrium reactions. Equations should be balanced according to the stoichiometry, the number of atoms of each species should be the same on both sides of the equation. This is achieved by scaling the number of involved molecules (A, B, C and D in a schematic example below) by the appropriate integers a, b, c and d.   \\\\mathrm{a\\\\ A + b\\\\ B \\\\longrightarrow c\\\\ C + d\\\\ D}  More elaborate reactions are represented by reaction schemes, which in addition to starting materials and products show important intermediates or transition states. Also, some relatively minor additions to the reaction can be indicated above the reaction arrow; examples of such additions are water, heat, illumination, a catalyst, etc. Similarly, some minor products can be placed below the arrow, often with a minus sign.   Retrosynthetic analysis can be applied to design a complex synthesis reaction. Here the analysis starts from the products, for example by splitting selected chemical bonds, to arrive at plausible initial reagents. A special arrow (⇒) is used in retro reactions.  Elementary reactionsThe elementary reaction is the smallest division into which a chemical reaction can be decomposed to, it has no intermediate products.  Most experimentally observed reactions are built up from many elementary reactions that occur in parallel or sequentially. The actual sequence of the individual elementary reactions is known as reaction mechanism. An elementary reaction involves a few molecules, usually one or two, because of the low probability for several molecules to meet at a certain time.  The most important elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule is involved in a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an isomerization or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans isomerization, in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa. In a typical dissociation reaction, a bond in a molecule splits (ruptures) resulting in two molecular fragments. The splitting can be homolytic or heterolytic. In the first case, the bond is divided so that each product retains an electron and becomes a neutral radical. In the second case, both electrons of the chemical bond remain with one of the products, resulting in charged ions. Dissociation plays an important role in triggering chain reactions, such as hydrogen–oxygen or polymerization reactions.  \\\\mathrm{AB \\\\longrightarrow A + B}    Dissociation of a molecule AB into fragments A and B   For bimolecular reactions, two molecules collide and react with each other. Their merger is called  chemical synthesis or an addition reaction.  \\\\mathrm{A + B \\\\longrightarrow AB}  Another possibility is that only a portion of one molecule is transferred to the other molecule. This type of reaction occurs, for example, in redox and acid-base reactions. In redox reactions, the transferred particle is an electron, whereas in acid-base reactions it is a proton. This type of reaction is also called metathesis.  \\\\mathrm{HA + B \\\\longrightarrow A + HB}  for example NaCl (aq)  + AgNO 3  (aq)  → NaNO 3  (aq)  + AgCl (s)  Chemical equilibrium  Most chemical reactions are reversible, that is they can and do run in both directions. The forward and reverse reactions are competing with each other and differ in reaction rates. These rates depend on the concentration and therefore change with time of the reaction: the reverse rate gradually increases and becomes equal to the rate of the forward reaction, establishing the so-called chemical equilibrium. The time to reach equilibrium depends on such parameters as temperature, pressure and the materials involved, and is determined by the minimum free energy. In equilibrium, the Gibbs free energy must be zero. The pressure dependence can be explained with the Le Chatelier\\'s principle. For example, an increase in pressure due to decreasing volume causes the reaction to shift to the side with the fewer moles of gas. The reaction yield stabilized at equilibrium, but can be increased by removing the product from the reaction mixture or increasing temperature or pressure. Change in the initial concentrations of the substances does not affect the equilibrium. ThermodynamicsChemical reactions are determined by the laws of thermodynamics. Reactions can proceed by themselves if they are exergonic, that is if they release energy. The associated free energy of the reaction is composed of two different thermodynamic quantities, enthalpy and entropy:   \\\\mathrm{\\\\Delta G = \\\\Delta H - T \\\\cdot \\\\Delta S}.    G: free energy, H: enthalpy, T: temperature, S: entropy, Δ: difference(change between original and product)   Reactions can be exothermic, where ΔH is negative and energy is released. Typical examples of exothermic reactions are precipitation and crystallization, in which ordered solids are formed from disordered gaseous or liquid phases. In contrast, in endothermic reactions, heat is consumed from the environment. This can occur by increasing the entropy of the system, often through the formation of gaseous reaction products, which have high entropy. Since the entropy increases with temperature, many endothermic reactions preferably take place at high temperatures. On the contrary, many exothermic reactions such as crystallization occur at low temperatures. Changes in temperature can sometimes reverse the direction of a reaction, as in the Boudouard reaction:  \\\\mathrm{CO_2 + C \\\\rightleftharpoons 2\\\\ CO\\\\ ; \\\\quad \\\\Delta H = +172.45\\\\  kJ \\\\cdot mol^{-1}}.  This reaction between carbon dioxide and carbon to form carbon monoxide is endothermic at temperatures above approximately 800 °C and is exothermic below this temperature. Reactions can also be characterized by the internal energy which takes into account changes in the entropy, volume and chemical potential. The latter depends, among other things, on the activities of the involved substances.   \\\\mathrm{d}U = T\\\\, {d}S - p\\\\, {d}V + \\\\mu\\\\, {d}n \\\\!    U: internal energy, S: entropy, p: pressure, μ: chemical potential, n: number of molecules, d: small change sign   KineticsThe speed at which a reactions takes place is studied by reaction kinetics. The rate depends on various parameters, such as: Reactant concentrations, which usually make the reaction happen at a faster rate if raised through increased collisions per unit time. Some reactions, however, have rates that are independent of reactant concentrations.  These are called zero order reactions. Surface area available for contact between the reactants, in particular solid ones in heterogeneous systems. Larger surface areas lead to higher reaction rates. Pressure – increasing the pressure decreases the volume between molecules and therefore increases the frequency of collisions between the molecules. Activation energy, which is defined as the amount of energy required to make the reaction start and carry on spontaneously. Higher activation energy implies that the reactants need more energy to start than a reaction with a lower activation energy. Temperature, which hastens reactions if raised, since higher temperature increases the energy of the molecules, creating more collisions per unit time, The presence or absence of a catalyst. Catalysts are substances which change the pathway (mechanism) of a reaction which in turn increases the speed of a reaction by lowering the activation energy needed for the reaction to take place. A catalyst is not destroyed or changed during a reaction, so it can be used again. For some reactions, the presence of electromagnetic radiation, most notably ultraviolet light, is needed to promote the breaking of bonds to start the reaction.  This is particularly true for reactions involving radicals. Several theories allow calculating the reaction rates at the molecular level. This field is referred to as reaction dynamics. The rate v of a first-order reaction, which could be disintegration of a substance A, is given by:   v= -\\\\frac {d[\\\\mathrm{A}]}{dt}= k \\\\cdot [\\\\mathrm{A}].   Its integration yields:  \\\\mathrm{[A]}(t) = \\\\mathrm{[A]}_{0} \\\\cdot e^{-k\\\\cdot t}.   Here k is first-order rate constant having dimension 1/time, [A](t) is concentration at a time t and [A] 0  is the initial concentration. The rate of a first-order reaction depends only on the concentration and the properties of the involved substance, and the reaction itself can be described with the characteristic half-life. More than one time constant is needed when describing reactions of higher order. The temperature dependence of the rate constant usually follows the Arrhenius equation:  k = k_0 e^   where E a  is the activation energy and k B  is the Boltzmann constant. One of the simplest models of reaction rate is the collision theory. More realistic models are tailored to a specific problem and include the transition state theory, the calculation of the potential energy surface, the Marcus theory and the Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory.  Reaction types Four basic types Synthesis  In a synthesis reaction, two or more simple substances combine to form a more complex substance. These reactions are in the general form: A + B → AB Two or more reactants yielding one product is another way to identify a synthesis reaction. One example of a synthesis reaction is the combination of iron and sulfur to form iron(II) sulfide: 8Fe + S 8  → 8FeS Another example is simple hydrogen gas combined with simple oxygen gas to produce a more complex substance, such as water. To react or not to react?. Utah State Office of Education. Retrieved 4 June 2011.  Decomposition  A decomposition reaction is the opposite of a synthesis reaction, where a more complex substance breaks down into its more simple parts. These reactions are in the general form: AB → A + B  Six Types of Chemical Reactions – MrGuch ChemFiesta.  One example of a decomposition reaction is the electrolysis of water to make oxygen and hydrogen gas: 2H 2 O → 2H 2  + O 2  Single replacementIn a single replacement reaction, a single uncombined element replaces another in a compound; in order words, one element trades places with another element in a compound  These reactions come in the general form of: A + BC → AC + B One example of a single displacement reaction is when magnesium replaces hydrogen in water to make magnesium hydroxide and hydrogen gas: Mg + 2H 2 O → Mg(OH) 2  + H 2  Double replacementIn a double replacement reaction, the anions and cations of two compounds switch places and form two entirely different compounds.  These reactions are in the general form: AB + CD → AD + CB  For example, when barium chloride (BaCl 2 ) and magnesium sulfate (MgSO 4 ) reaction, the SO 4  2-  anion switches places with the 2Cl -  anion, giving the compounds BaSO 4  and MgCl 2 . Another example of a double displacement reaction is the reaction of lead(II) nitrate with potassium iodide to form lead(II) iodide and potassium nitrate: Pb(NO 3 ) 2  + 2 KI → PbI 2  + 2 KNO 3  Oxidation and reduction Redox reactions can be understood in terms of transfer of electrons from one involved species (reducing agent) to another (oxidizing agent). In this process, the former species is oxidized and the latter is reduced, thus the term redox. Though sufficient for many purposes, these descriptions are not precisely correct. Oxidation is better defined as an increase in oxidation number, and reduction as a decrease in oxidation number. In practice, the transfer of electrons will always change the oxidation number, but there are many reactions that are classed as \"redox\" even though no electron transfer occurs (such as those involving covalent bonds).  An example of a redox reaction is: 2 S 2 O 3  2−  (aq)  + I 2  (aq)  → S 4 O 6  2–  (aq)  + 2 I −  (aq)  Here I 2  is reduced to I –  and S 2 O 3  2–  (thiosulfate anion) is oxidized to S 4 O 6  2– .Which of the involved reactants would be reducing or oxidizing agent can be predicted from the electronegativity of their elements. Elements with low electronegativity, such as most metals, easily donate electrons and oxidize – they are reducing agents. On the contrary, many ions with high oxidation numbers, such as  ,  ,  ,  ,  ) can gain one or two extra electrons and are strong oxidizing agents.The number of electrons donated or accepted in a redox reaction can be predicted from electron configuration of the reactant element. Elements are trying to reach the low-energy noble gas configuration, and therefore alkali metals and halogens will donate and accept one electron, respectively, and the noble gases themselves are chemically inactive. An important class of redox reactions are the electrochemical reactions, where the electrons from the power supply are used as a reducing agent. These reactions are particularly important for the production of chemical elements, such as chlorine  or aluminium. The reverse process in which electrons are released in redox reactions and can be used as electrical energy is possible and is used in the batteries. Complexation In complexation reactions, several ligands react with a metal atom to form a coordination complex. This is achieved by providing lone pairs of the ligand into empty orbitals of the metal atom and forming dipolar bonds. The ligands are Lewis bases, they can be both ions and neutral molecules, such as carbon monoxide, ammonia or water. The number of ligands that react with a central metal atom can be found using the 18-electron rule, saying that the valence shells of a transition metal will collectively accommodate 18 electrons, whereas the symmetry of the resulting complex can be predicted with the crystal field theory and ligand field theory. Complexation reactions also include ligand exchange, in which one or more ligands are replaced by another, and redox processes which change the oxidation state of the central metal atom.  Acid-base reactionsAcid-base reactions involve transfer of protons from one molecule (acid) to another (base). Here, acids act as proton donors and bases as acceptors.  \\\\mathrm{HA + B \\\\rightleftharpoons A^- + HB^+}    Acid-base reaction, HA: acid, B: Base, A – : conjugated base, HB + : conjugated acid   The associated proton transfer results in the so-called conjugate acid and conjugate base.  The reverse reaction is possible, and thus the acid/base and conjugated base/acid are always in equilibrium. The equilibrium is determined by the acid and base dissociation constants (K a  and K b ) of the involved substances. A special case of the acid-base reaction is the neutralization where an acid and a base, taken at exactly same amounts, form a neutral salt.Acid-base reactions can have different definitions depending on the acid-base concept employed. Some of the most common are: Arrhenius definition: Acids dissociate in water releasing H 3 O +  ions; bases dissociate in water releasing OH –  ions. Brønsted-Lowry definition: Acids are proton (H + ) donors, bases are proton acceptors; this includes the Arrhenius definition. Lewis definition: Acids are electron-pair acceptors, bases are electron-pair donors; this includes the Brønsted-Lowry definition. Precipitation Precipitation is the formation of a solid in a solution or inside another solid during a chemical reaction. It usually takes place when the concentration of dissolved ions exceeds the solubility limit  and forms an insoluble salt. This process can be assisted by adding a precipitating agent or by removal of the solvent. Rapid precipitation results in an amorphous or microcrystalline residue and slow process can yield single crystals. The latter can also be obtained by recrystallization from microcrystalline salts.  Solid-state reactionsReactions can take place between two solids. However, because of the relatively small diffusion rates in solids, the corresponding chemical reactions are very slow in comparison to liquid and gas phase reactions. They are accelerated by increasing the reaction temperature and finely dividing the reactant to increase the contacting surface area.  Photochemical reactions In photochemical reactions, atoms and molecules absorb energy (photons) of the illumination light and convert into an excited state. They can then release this energy by breaking chemical bonds, thereby producing radicals. Photochemical reactions include hydrogen–oxygen reactions, radical polymerization, chain reactions and rearrangement reactions. Many important processes involve photochemistry. The premier example is photosynthesis, in which most plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on photochemistry for the formation of vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin. Christophe Dugave Cis-trans isomerization in biochemistry, Wiley-VCH, 2006 ISBN 3-527-31304-4 p. 56  In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence.  Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry. Catalysis  In catalysis, the reaction does not proceed directly, but through a third substance known as catalyst. Unlike other reagents that participate in the chemical reaction, a catalyst is not consumed by the reaction itself; however, it can be inhibited, deactivated or destroyed by secondary processes. Catalysts can be used in a different phase (heterogeneous) or in the same phase (homogenous) as the reactants. In heterogeneous catalysis, typical secondary processes include coking where the catalyst becomes covered by polymeric side products. Additionally, heterogeneous catalysts can dissolve into the solution in a solid–liquid system or evaporate in a solid–gas system. Catalysts can only speed up the reaction – chemicals that slow down the reaction are called inhibitors.   Substances that increase the activity of catalysts are called promoters, and substances that deactivate catalysts are called catalytic poisons. With a catalyst, a reaction which is kinetically inhibited by a high activation energy can take place in circumvention of this activation energy.Heterogeneous catalysts are usually solids, powdered in order to maximize their surface area. Of particular importance in heterogeneous catalysis are the platinum group metals and other transition metals, which are used in hydrogenations, catalytic reforming and in the synthesis of commodity chemicals such as nitric acid and ammonia. Acids are an example of a homogeneous catalyst, they increase the nucleophilicity of carbonyls, allowing a reaction that would not otherwise proceed with electrophiles. The advantage of homogeneous catalysts is the ease of mixing them with the reactants, but they may also be difficult to separate from the products. Therefore, heterogeneous catalysts are preferred in many industrial processes.  Reactions in organic chemistryIn organic chemistry, in addition to oxidation, reduction or acid-base reactions, a number of other reactions can take place which involve covalent bonds between carbon atoms or carbon and heteroatoms (such as oxygen, nitrogen, halogens, etc.). Many specific reactions in organic chemistry are name reactions designated after their discoverers. SubstitutionIn a substitution reaction, a functional group in a particular chemical compound is replaced by another group.    These reactions can be distinguished by the type of substituting species into a nucleophilic, electrophilic or radical substitution.  In the first type, a nucleophile, an atom or molecule with an excess of electrons and thus a negative charge or partial charge, replaces another atom or part of the \"substrate\" molecule. The electron pair from the nucleophile attacks the substrate forming a new bond, while the leaving group departs with an electron pair. The nucleophile may be electrically neutral or negatively charged, whereas the substrate is typically neutral or positively charged. Examples of nucleophiles are hydroxide ion, alkoxides, amines and halides. This type of reaction is found mainly in aliphatic hydrocarbons, and rarely in aromatic hydrocarbon. The latter have high electron density and enter nucleophilic aromatic substitution only with very strong electron withdrawing groups. Nucleophilic substitution can take place by two different mechanisms, S N 1 and S N 2. In their names, S stands for substitution, N for nucleophilic, and the number represents the kinetic order of the reaction, unimolecular or bimolecular.   The S N 1 reaction proceeds in two steps. First, the leaving group is eliminated creating a carbocation. This is followed by a rapid reaction with the nucleophile. In the S N 2 mechanism, the nucleophile forms a transition state with the attacked molecule, and only then the leaving group is cleaved. These two mechanisms differ in the stereochemistry of the products. S N 1 leads to the non-stereospecific addition and does not result in a chiral center, but rather in a set of geometric isomers (cis/trans). In contrast, a reversal (Walden inversion) of the previously existing stereochemistry is observed in the S N 2 mechanism. Electrophilic substitution is the counterpart of the nucleophilic substitution in that the attacking atom or molecule, an electrophile, has low electron density and thus a positive charge. Typical electrophiles are the carbon atom of carbonyl groups, carbocations or sulfur or nitronium cations. This reaction takes place almost exclusively in aromatic hydrocarbons, where it is called electrophilic aromatic substitution. The electrophile attack results in the so-called σ-complex, a transition state in which the aromatic system is abolished. Then, the leaving group, usually a proton, is split off and the aromaticity is restored. An alternative to aromatic substitution is electrophilic aliphatic substitution. It is similar to the nucleophilic aliphatic substitution and also has two major types, S E 1 and S E 2    In the third type of substitution reaction, radical substitution, the attacking particle is a radical.  This process usually takes the form of a chain reaction, for example in the reaction of alkanes with halogens. In the first step, light or heat disintegrates the halogen-containing molecules producing the radicals. Then the reaction proceeds as an avalanche until two radicals meet and recombine.   \\\\mathrm{X{\\\\cdot} + R{-}H \\\\longrightarrow X{-}H + R{\\\\cdot}}   \\\\mathrm{R{\\\\cdot} + X_2 \\\\longrightarrow R{-}X + X{\\\\cdot}}    Reactions during the chain reaction of radical substitution   Addition and eliminationThe addition and its counterpart, the elimination, are reactions which change the number of substitutents on the carbon atom, and form or cleave multiple bonds. Double and triple bonds can be produced by eliminating a suitable leaving group. Similar to the nucleophilic substitution, there are several possible reaction mechanisms which are named after the respective reaction order. In the E1 mechanism, the leaving group is ejected first, forming a carbocation. The next step, formation of the double bond, takes place with elimination of a proton (deprotonation). The leaving order is reversed in the E1cb mechanism, that is the proton is split off first. This mechanism requires participation of a base.  Because of the similar conditions, both reactions in the E1 or E1cb elimination always compete with the S N 1 substitution.     The E2 mechanism also requires a base, but there the attack of the base and the elimination of the leaving group proceed simultaneously and produce no ionic intermediate. In contrast to the E1 eliminations, different stereochemical configurations are possible for the reaction product in the E2 mechanism, because the attack of the base preferentially occurs in the anti-position with respect to the leaving group. Because of the similar conditions and reagents, the E2 elimination is always in competition with the S N 2-substitution.  The counterpart of elimination is the addition where double or triple bonds are converted into single bonds. Similar to the substitution reactions, there are several types of additions distinguished by the type of the attacking particle. For example, in the electrophilic addition of hydrogen bromide, an electrophile (proton) attacks the double bond forming a carbocation, which then reacts with the nucleophile (bromine). The carbocation can be formed on either side of the double bond depending on the groups attached to its ends, and the preferred configuration can be predicted with the Markovnikov\\'s rule.  This rule states that \"In the heterolytic addition of a polar molecule to an alkene or alkyne, the more electronegative (nucleophilic) atom (or part) of the polar molecule becomes attached to the carbon atom bearing the smaller number of hydrogen atoms.\" If the addition of a functional group takes place at the less substituted carbon atom of the double bond, then the electrophilic substitution with acids is not possible. In this case, one has to use the hydroboration–oxidation reaction, where in the first step, the boron atom acts as electrophile and adds to the less substituted carbon atom. At the second step, the nucleophilic hydroperoxide or halogen anion attacks the boron atom. While the addition to the electron-rich alkenes and alkynes is mainly electrophilic, the nucleophilic addition plays an important role for the carbon-heteroatom multiple bonds, and especially its most important representative, the carbonyl group. This process is often associated with an elimination, so that after the reaction the carbonyl group is present again. It is therefore called addition-elimination reaction and may occur in carboxylic acid derivatives such as chlorides, esters or anhydrides. This reaction is often catalyzed by acids or bases, where the acids increase by the electrophilicity of the carbonyl group by binding to the oxygen atom, whereas the bases enhance the nucleophilicity of the attacking nucleophile.   Nucleophilic addition of a carbanion or another nucleophile to the double bond of an alpha, beta unsaturated carbonyl compound can proceed via the Michael reaction, which belongs to the larger class of conjugate additions. This is one of the most useful methods for the mild formation of C-C bonds.   Some additions which can not be executed with nucleophiles and electrophiles, can be succeeded with free radicals. As with the free-radical substitution, the radical addition proceeds as a chain reaction, and such reactions are the basis of the free-radical polymerization.  Other organic reaction mechanisms  In a rearrangement reaction, the carbon skeleton of a molecule is rearranged to give a structural isomer of the original molecule. These include hydride shift reactions such as the Wagner-Meerwein rearrangement, where a hydrogen, alkyl or aryl group migrates from one carbon to a neighboring carbon. Most rearrangements are associated with the breaking and formation of new carbon-carbon bonds. Other examples are sigmatropic reaction such as the Cope rearrangement. Cyclic rearrangements include cycloadditions and, more generally, pericyclic reactions, wherein two or more double bond-containing molecules form a cyclic molecule. An important example of cycloaddition reaction is the Diels–Alder reaction (the so-called [4+2] cycloaddition) between a conjugated diene and a substituted alkene to form a substituted cyclohexene system. Whether or not a certain cycloaddition would proceed depends on the electronic orbitals of the participating species, as only orbitals with the same sign of wave function will overlap and interact constructively to form new bonds. Cycloaddition is usually assisted by light or heat. These perturbations result in different arrangement of electrons in the excited state of the involved molecules and therefore in different effects. For example, the [4+2] Diels-Alder reactions can be assisted by heat whereas the [2+2] cycloaddition is selectively induced by light.  Because of the orbital character, the potential for developing stereoisomeric products upon cycloaddition is limited, as described by the Woodward-Hoffmann rules.  Biochemical reactions Biochemical reactions are mainly controlled by enzymes. These proteins can specifically catalyze a single reaction, so that reactions can be controlled very precisely. The reaction takes place in the active site, a small part of the enzyme which is usually found in a cleft or pocket lined by amino acid residues, and the rest of the enzyme is used mainly for stabilization. The catalytic action of enzymes relies on several mechanisms including the molecular shape (\"induced fit\"), bond strain, proximity and orientation of molecules relative to the enzyme, proton donation or withdrawal (acid/base catalysis), electrostatic interactions and many others. The biochemical reactions that occur in living organisms are collectively known as metabolism. Among the most important of its mechanisms is the anabolism, in which different DNA and enzyme-controlled processes result in the production of large molecules such as proteins and carbohydrates from smaller units.  Bioenergetics studies the sources of energy for such reactions. An important energy source is glucose, which can be produced by plants via photosynthesis or assimilated from food. All organisms use this energy to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which can then be used to energize other reactions. Applications Chemical reactions are central to chemical engineering where they are used for the synthesis of new compounds from natural raw materials such as petroleum and mineral ores. It is essential to make the reaction as efficient as possible, maximizing the yield and minimizing the amount of reagents, energy inputs and waste. Catalysts are especially helpful for reducing the energy required for the reaction and increasing its reaction rate.  Some specific reactions have their niche applications. For example, the thermite reaction is used to generate light and heat in pyrotechnics and welding. Although it is less controllable than the more conventional oxy-fuel welding, arc welding and flash welding, it requires much less equipment and is still used to mend rails, especially in remote areas.  MonitoringMechanisms of monitoring chemical reactions depend strongly on the reaction rate. Relatively slow processes can be analyzed in situ for the concentrations and identities of the individual ingredients. Important tools of real time analysis are the measurement of pH and analysis of optical absorption (color) and emission spectra. A less accessible but rather efficient method is introduction of a radioactive isotope into the reaction and monitoring how it changes over time and where it moves to; this method is often used to analyze redistribution of substances in the human body. Faster reactions are usually studied with ultrafast laser spectroscopy where utilization of femtosecond lasers allows short-lived transition states to be monitored  at time scaled down to a few femtoseconds.

At the foundation of the new rule, they were called Hermits of St Damiano, or Moronites (or Murronites), and did not assume the appellation of Celestines until after the election of their founder to the Papacy as Celestine V.  The fame of the holy life and the austerities practised by the hermit in his solitude on the Mountain of Majella, near Sulmona, attracted many visitors, several of whom were moved to remain and share his mode of life. They built a small convent on the spot inhabited by the holy hermit, which became too small for the accommodation of those who came to share their life of privations. Peter of Morone, their founder built a number of other small oratories in that neighborhood. FoundingThis happened about the year 1254. A new religious community was formed, and Peter of Morone gave them a rule formulated in accordance with his own practices. In 1264 the new institution was approved by Urban IV. The founder, having heard that it was probable that Pope Gregory X, then holding a council at Lyon, would suppress all such new orders as had been founded since the Lateran Council, having commanded that such institutions should not be further multiplied, went to Lyon. There he  succeeded in persuading Gregory to approve his new order, making it a branch of the Benedictines and following the rule of Saint Benedict, but adding to it additional severities and privations. Gregory took it under the Papal protection, assured to it the possession of all property it might acquire, and endowed it with exemption from the authority of the ordinary. Nothing more was needed to ensure the rapid spread of the new association and Peter the hermit of Morone lived to see himself \"Superior-General\" to thirty-six monasteries and more than six hundred monks. Peter, however, cannot be accused of ambition or the lust of power when a monastic superior, any more than when he insisted on divesting himself of the Papacy, to which he was subsequently raised. As soon as he had seen his new order thus consolidated he gave up the government of it to a certain Robert, and retired once again to a still more remote solitude to give himself up more entirely to solitary penance and prayer. Shortly afterwards, in a chapter of the order held in 1293, the original monastery of Majella being judged to be too desolate and exposed to too rigorous a climate, it was decided that the monastery which had been founded in Sulmtona should be the headquarters of the order and the residence of the General-Superior, as it has continued to be to the present day. The next year Peter of Morrone, having been, despite his reluctance, elected Pope by the name of Celestine V, the order he had founded took the name of Celestines. The hermit Pope found time in the few short months of his Papacy to confirm the rule of the order, which he had himself composed, and to confer on the society a variety of special graces and privileges. In the only creation of cardinals promoted by him, among the twelve raised to the purple, there were two monks of his order. He found time also to visit personally the great Benedictine monastery on Monte Cassino, where he succeeded in persuading the monks to accept his more rigorous rule. He sent fifty monks of his order to introduce it, who remained, however, for only a few months.After the death of the founder the order was favoured and privileged by Benedict XI, and rapidly spread through Italy, Germany, Flanders, and France, where they were received by Philip the Fair in 1300. Subsequently the French Celestines, with the consent of the Italian superiors of the order, and of Pope Martin V in 1427, obtained the privilege of making new constitutions for themselves, which they did in the 17th century in a series of regulations accepted by the provincial chapter in 1667. At that time the French congregation of the order was composed of twenty-one monasteries, the head of which was that of Paris, and was governed by a Provincial with the authority of General. Paul V was a notable benefactor of the order. But in consequence of later political changes and events the order has been dissolved. Description of orderAccording to their special constitutions the Celestines were bound to say matins in the choir at two o\\'clock in the morning, and always to abstain from eating meat, save in illness. The distinct rules of their order with regard to fasting are numerous, but not more severe than those of similar congregations, though much more so than is required by the old Benedictine rule. In reading their minute directions for divers degrees of abstinence on various days, it is impossible to avoid being struck by the conviction that the great object of the framers of these rules was the general purpose of ensuring an ascetic mode of life.The Celestines wore a white woollen cassock bound with a linen band, and a leathern girdle of the same colour, with a scapular unattached to the body of the dress, and a black hood. It was not permitted to them to wear any shirt save of serge. Their dress in short was very like that of the Cistercians. But it is a tradition in the order that in the time of the founder they wore a coarse brown cloth. The church and monastery of San Pietro in Montorio originally belonged to the Celestines in Rome; but they were turned out of it by Sixtus IV to make way for Franciscans, receiving from the Pope in exchange the Church of St Eusebius of Vercelli with the adjacent mansion for a monastery.

Delta (uppercase Δ, lowercase δ;   Délta; Modern Greek  ) is the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. In the system of Greek numerals it has a value of 4. It was derived from the Phoenician letter Dalet . Letters that come from delta include Latin D and Cyrillic Д.A river delta (originally, the Nile River delta) is so named because its shape approximates the upper-case letter delta (the shape is a triangle). Pronunciation and originIn Ancient Greek, it represented a voiced dental plosive  . In Modern Greek, it represents a voiced dental fricative  , like the \"th\" in \"that\" or \"this\".

    "document_2_ld_output = {991: 'Absolute value   In mathematics, the absolute value (or modulus)   of a real number\\xa0  is the non-negative value of\\xa0  without regard to its sign. Namely,   for a positive\\xa0 ,   for a negative\\xa0 , and  . For example, the absolute value of\\xa03 is 3, and the absolute value of\\xa0−3 is also 3. The absolute value of a number may be thought of as its distance from zero.Generalizations of the absolute value for real numbers occur in a wide variety of mathematical settings. For example an absolute value is also defined for the complex numbers, the quaternions, ordered rings, fields and vector spaces. The absolute value is closely related to the notions of magnitude, distance, and norm in various mathematical and physical contexts. Terminology and notationJean-Robert Argand introduced the term \"module\", meaning \\'unit of measure\\' in French, in 1806 specifically for the complex absolute value Oxford English Dictionary, Draft Revision, June 2008   and it was borrowed into English in 1866 as the Latin equivalent \"modulus\".  The term \"absolute value\" has been used in this sense since at least 1806 in French  and 1857 in English.  The notation   was introduced by Karl Weierstrass in 1841.  Other names for absolute value include \"the numerical value\"  and \"the magnitude\". The same notation is used with sets to denote cardinality; the meaning depends on context. Definition and properties Real numbersFor any real number\\xa0  the absolute value or modulus of\\xa0  is denoted by   (a vertical bar on each side of the quantity) and is defined as   |x| = \\\\begin{cases} x, & \\\\mbox{if }  x \\\\ge 0  \\\\\\\\ -x,  & \\\\mbox{if } x   As can be seen from the above definition, the absolute value of\\xa0  is always either positive or zero, but never negative.From an analytic geometry point of view, the absolute value of a real number is that number\\'s distance from zero along the real number line, and more generally the absolute value of the difference of two real numbers is the distance between them. Indeed the notion of an abstract  distance function in mathematics can be seen to be a generalization of  the absolute value of the difference (see \"Distance\" below).Since the square-root notation without sign represents the positive square root, it follows that |- | style=\"width: 250px\" |  |a| = \\\\sqrt{a^2}  | ( ) |}which is sometimes used as a definition of absolute value. The absolute value has the following four fundamental properties: |- | style=\"width: 250px\" | |a| \\\\ge 0   | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) | Non-negativity |- | |a| = 0 \\\\iff a = 0   | ( ) |Positive-definiteness |- | |ab| = |a||b|\\\\,  | ( ) |Multiplicativeness |- | |a+b|  \\\\le |a| + |b|    | ( ) |Subadditivity |}Other important properties of the absolute value include: |- | style=\"width:250px\" | ||a|| = |a|\\\\,  | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) |Idempotence (the absolute value of the absolute value is the absolute value) |- | style=\"width:250px\" | |-a| = |a|\\\\,  | style=\"width: 100px\" | ( ) |Symmetry |- | |a - b| = 0 \\\\iff a = b   | ( ) |Identity of indiscernibles (equivalent to positive-definiteness) |- | |a - b|  \\\\le |a - c| +|c - b|    | ( ) |Triangle inequality (equivalent to subadditivity) |- | |a/b| = |a| / |b| \\\\mbox{ (if } b \\\\ne 0) \\\\,  | ( ) |Preservation of division (equivalent to multiplicativeness) |- | |a-b| \\\\ge ||a| - |b||   | ( ) |(equivalent to subadditivity) |}Two other useful properties concerning inequalities are:  |a| \\\\le b \\\\iff -b \\\\le a \\\\le b    |a| \\\\ge b \\\\iff a \\\\le -b \\\\mbox{ or } b \\\\le a   These relations may be used to solve inequalities involving absolute values. For example: |- | |x-3| \\\\le 9   | \\\\iff -9 \\\\le x-3 \\\\le 9   |- | | \\\\iff -6 \\\\le x \\\\le 12   |}Absolute value is used to define the absolute difference, the standard metric on the real numbers. Complex numbersSince the complex numbers are not ordered, the definition given above for the real absolute value cannot be directly generalized for a complex number. However the geometric interpretation of the absolute value of a real number as its distance from 0 can be generalized. The absolute value of a complex number is defined as its distance in the complex plane from the origin using the Pythagorean theorem. More generally the absolute value of the difference of two complex numbers is equal to the distance between those two complex numbers.For any complex number  z = x + iy,\\\\,  where   and   are real numbers, the absolute value or modulus of\\xa0  is denoted   and is given by  |z| =  \\\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}.  When  the complex part   is zero this is the same as the absolute value of the real number\\xa0 .When a complex number\\xa0  is expressed in polar form as  z = r e^{i \\\\theta}  with   and θ real, its absolute value is   |z| = r . The absolute value of a complex number can be written in the complex analogue of equation\\xa0(1) above as:   |z| = \\\\sqrt{z \\\\cdot \\\\overline{z}}   where  \\\\overline z  is the complex conjugate of\\xa0 . The complex absolute value shares all the properties of the real absolute value given in equations\\xa0(2)–(11) above.Since the positive reals form a subgroup of the complex numbers under multiplication, we may think of absolute value as an endomorphism of the multiplicative group of the complex numbers.  Absolute value function The real absolute value function is continuous everywhere. It is differentiable everywhere except for  \\xa0=\\xa00.  It is monotonically decreasing on the interval   and monotonically increasing on the interval  . Since a real number and its negative have the same absolute value, it is an even function, and is hence not invertible.Both the real and complex functions are idempotent.It is a piecewise linear, convex function. Relationship to the sign functionThe absolute value function of a real number returns its value irrespective of its sign, whereas the sign (or signum) function returns a number\\'s sign irrespective of its value. The following equations show the relationship between these two functions:  |x| = x \\\\sgn(x),  and for  ,  \\\\sgn(x) = \\\\frac{|x|}{x}.  DerivativeThe real absolute value function has a derivative for every  , but is not differentiable at  . Its derivative for   is given by the step function Weisstein, Eric W. Absolute Value. From MathWorld – A Wolfram Web Resource.  Bartel and Sherbert, p.\\xa0163   \\\\frac{d|x|}{dx} = \\\\frac{x}{|x|} = \\\\begin{cases} -1 & x 0. \\\\end{cases}  The subdifferential of\\xa0  at\\xa0  is the interval\\xa0 . The complex absolute value function is continuous everywhere but complex differentiable nowhere because it violates the Cauchy–Riemann equations. The second derivative of\\xa0  with respect to\\xa0  is zero everywhere except zero, where it does not exist. As a generalized function, the second derivative may be taken as two times the Dirac delta function. AntiderivativeThe antiderivative (indefinite integral) of the absolute value function is  \\\\int|x|dx=\\\\frac{x|x|}{2}+C,  where   is an arbitrary constant of integration. Distance  The absolute value is closely related to the idea of distance. As noted above, the absolute value of a real or complex number is the distance from that number to the origin, along the real number line, for real numbers, or in the complex plane, for complex numbers, and more generally, the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers is the distance between them.The standard Euclidean distance between two points  a = (a_1, a_2, \\\\dots , a_n)   and  b = (b_1, b_2, \\\\dots , b_n)   in Euclidean  -space is defined as:  \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n(a_i-b_i)^2}.   This can be seen to be a generalization of  , since if   and   are real, then by equation\\xa0(1),  |a - b| = \\\\sqrt{(a - b)^2}.  While if   a = a_1 + i a_2 \\\\,  and   b = b_1 + i b_2 \\\\,  are complex numbers, then |- | |a - b| \\\\,  |  = |(a_1 + i a_2) - (b_1 + i b_2)|\\\\,  |- | |  = |(a_1 - b_1) + i(a_2 - b_2)|\\\\,  |- | |  = \\\\sqrt{(a_1 - b_1)^2 + (a_2 - b_2)^2}.  |}The above shows that the \"absolute value\" distance for the real numbers or the complex numbers, agrees with the standard Euclidean distance they inherit as a result of considering them as the one and two-dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively.The properties of the absolute value of the difference of two real or complex numbers: non-negativity, identity of indiscernibles, symmetry and the triangle inequality given above, can be seen to motivate the more general notion of a distance function as follows:A real valued function   on a set   is called a metric (or a distance function) on\\xa0 , if it satisfies the following four axioms:  |- |style=\"width:250px\" |  d(a, b) \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | d(a, b) = 0 \\\\iff a = b   |Identity of indiscernibles |- | d(a, b) = d(b, a) \\\\,  |Symmetry |- | d(a, b)  \\\\le d(a, c) + d(c, b)    |Triangle inequality |} Generalizations Ordered ringsThe definition of absolute value given for real numbers above can be extended to any ordered ring. That is, if\\xa0  is an element of an ordered ring\\xa0R, then the absolute value of\\xa0 , denoted by  , is defined to be:   |a| = \\\\begin{cases} a, & \\\\mbox{if }  a \\\\ge 0  \\\\\\\\ -a,  & \\\\mbox{if } a \\\\le 0 \\\\end{cases} \\\\;   where   is the additive inverse of\\xa0 , and 0 is the additive identity element. Fields  The fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers given in (2)–(5) above, can be used to generalize the notion of absolute value to an arbitrary field, as follows.A real-valued function\\xa0  on a field\\xa0F is called an absolute value (also a modulus, magnitude, value, or valuation)  if it satisfies the following four axioms: |- | v(a) \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | v(a) = 0 \\\\iff a = \\\\mathbf{0}   |Positive-definiteness |- | v(ab) = v(a) v(b) \\\\,  |Multiplicativeness |- | v(a+b)  \\\\le v(a) + v(b)    |Subadditivity or the triangle inequality |}Where 0 denotes the additive identity element of\\xa0F. It follows from positive-definiteness and multiplicativeness that  , where 1 denotes the multiplicative identity element of\\xa0F. The real and complex absolute values defined above are examples of absolute values for an arbitrary field.If   is an absolute value on\\xa0F, then the function\\xa0  on  , defined by  , is a metric and the following are equivalent: d satisfies the ultrametric inequality  d(x, y) \\\\leq \\\\max(d(x,z),d(y,z))  for all  ,  ,   in\\xa0F.   \\\\big\\\\{ v\\\\Big({\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^n } \\\\mathbf{1}\\\\Big) : n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N} \\\\big\\\\}   is bounded in\\xa0R.   v\\\\Big({\\\\textstyle \\\\sum_{k=1}^n } \\\\mathbf{1}\\\\Big) \\\\le 1 \\\\text{ for every } n \\\\in \\\\mathbb{N}.    v(a) \\\\le 1 \\\\Rightarrow v(1+a) \\\\le 1 \\\\text{ for all } a \\\\in F.    v(a + b) \\\\le \\\\mathrm{max}\\\\{v(a), v(b)\\\\} \\\\text{ for all } a, b \\\\in F.  An absolute value which satisfies any (hence all) of the above conditions is said to be non-Archimedean, otherwise it is said to be Archimedean.  Vector spaces  Again the fundamental properties of the absolute value for real numbers can be used, with a slight modification, to generalize the notion to an arbitrary vector space.A real-valued function on a vector space\\xa0V over a field\\xa0F, represented as ‖V‖, is called an absolute value (or more usually a norm) if it satisfies the following axioms:For all\\xa0  in\\xa0F, and v, u in\\xa0V, |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|  \\\\ge 0   |Non-negativity |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| = 0 \\\\iff \\\\mathbf{v} = 0  |Positive-definiteness |- | \\\\|a \\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| = |a| \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\|   |Positive homogeneity or positive scalability |- | \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v} + \\\\mathbf{u}\\\\| \\\\le \\\\|\\\\mathbf{v}\\\\| + \\\\|\\\\mathbf{u}\\\\|   |Subadditivity or the triangle inequality |}The norm of a vector is also called its length or magnitude.In the case of Euclidean space\\xa0R n , the function defined by  \\\\|(x_1, x_2, \\\\dots , x_n) \\\\| = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i^2}  is a norm called the Euclidean norm. When the real numbers\\xa0R are considered as the one-dimensional vector space\\xa0R 1 , the absolute value is a norm, and is the  -norm for any\\xa0 . In fact the absolute value is the \"only\" norm on R 1 , in the sense that, for every norm   on\\xa0R 1 ,  . The complex absolute value is a special case of the norm in an inner product space. It is identical to the Euclidean norm, if the complex plane is identified with the Euclidean plane\\xa0R 2 .

External links',6934: 'Condition number In the field of  numerical analysis, the condition number of a function with respect to an argument measures the asymptotically worst case of how much the function can change in proportion to small changes in the argument. The \"function\" is the solution of a problem and the \"arguments\" are the data in the problem.A problem with a low condition number is said to be well-conditioned, while a problem with a high condition number is said to be ill-conditioned.The condition number is a property of the problem.  Paired with the problem are any number of algorithms that can be used to solve the problem, that is, to calculate the solution.  Some algorithms have a property called backward stability. In general, a backward stable algorithm can be expected to accurately solve well-conditioned problems. Numerical analysis textbooks give formulas for the condition numbers of problems and identify the backward stable algorithms.As a general rule of thumb, if the condition number  \\\\kappa(A) = 10^k , then you may lose up to  k  digits of accuracy on top of what would be lost to the numerical method due to loss of precision from arithmetic methods. Numerical Mathematics and Computing, by Cheney and Kincaid.  However, the condition number does not give the exact value of the maximum inaccuracy that may occur in the algorithm. It generally just bounds it with an estimate (whose computed value depends on the choice of the norm to measure the inaccuracy). ==Matrices== For example, the condition number associated with the linear equation Ax\\xa0=\\xa0b gives a bound on how inaccurate the solution x will be after approximation. Note that this is before the effects of round-off error are taken into account; conditioning is a property of the matrix, not the algorithm or floating point accuracy of the computer used to solve the corresponding system. In particular, one should think of the condition number as being (very roughly) the rate at which the solution, x, will change with respect to a change in b.  Thus, if the condition number is large, even a small error in b may cause a large error in x. On the other hand, if the condition number is small then the error in x will not be much bigger than the error in b.The condition number is defined more precisely to be the maximum ratio of the relative error in x divided by the relative error in b.Let e be the error in b. Assuming that A is a square matrix, the error in the solution A −1 b is A −1 e. The ratio of the relative error in the solution to the relative error in b is   \\\\frac{ \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} b \\\\right\\\\Vert }{ \\\\left\\\\Vert e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert b \\\\right\\\\Vert } .  This is easily transformed to   \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} e \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert e \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\right) \\\\cdot \\\\left( \\\\left\\\\Vert b \\\\right\\\\Vert / \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} b \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\right) .  The maximum value (for nonzero b and e) is easily seen to be the product of the two operator norms:   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\left\\\\Vert A^{-1} \\\\right\\\\Vert \\\\cdot \\\\left\\\\Vert A \\\\right\\\\Vert .  The same definition is used for any  consistent norm, i.e. one that satisfies   \\\\kappa(A) \\\\ge 1 .\\\\,  When the condition number is exactly one, then the algorithm may find an approximation of the solution with an arbitrary precision. However it does not mean that the algorithm will converge rapidly to this solution, just that it won\\'t diverge arbitrarily because of inaccuracy on the source data (backward error), provided that the forward error introduced by the algorithm does not diverge as well because of accumulating intermediate rounding errors.The condition number may also be infinite, in which case the algorithm will not reliably find a solution to the problem, not even a weak approximation of it (and not even its order of magnitude) with any reasonable and provable accuracy.Of course, this definition depends on the choice of norm: If   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|   is the norm (usually noted as   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|_2  ) defined in the square-summable sequence space ℓ 2  (which also matches the usual distance in a continuous and isotropic cartesian space), then   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{\\\\max}(A)}{\\\\sigma_{\\\\min}(A)} ,  where   \\\\sigma_{\\\\max}(A)  and  \\\\sigma_{\\\\min}(A)   are maximal and minimal singular values of  A  respectively. Hence If  A  is normal then   \\\\kappa(A) = \\\\left|\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_{\\\\max}(A)}{\\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(A)}\\\\right| ,  where   \\\\lambda_{\\\\max}(A)  and  \\\\lambda_{\\\\min}(A)   are maximal and minimal (by moduli) eigenvalues of  A  respectively. If  A  is unitary then   \\\\kappa(A) = 1 .\\\\,  This number arises so often in numerical linear algebra that it is given a name, the condition number of a matrix. If   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|   is the norm (usually noted as   \\\\left\\\\| \\\\cdot \\\\right\\\\|_\\\\infty  ) defined in the sequence space ℓ ∞  of all bounded sequences (which also matches the non-linear distance measured as the maximum of distances measured on projections into the base subspaces, without requiring the space to be isotropic or even just linear, but only continuous, such norm being definable on all Banach spaces), and  A  is lower triangular non-singular (i.e.,   \\\\forall i, a_{ii} \\\\ne 0 \\\\, ) then   \\\\kappa(A) \\\\geq \\\\frac{\\\\max_i(|a_{ii}|)}{\\\\min_i(|a_{ii}|)} .  The condition number computed with this norm is generally larger than the condition number computed with square-summable sequences, but it can be evaluated more easily (and this is often the only measurable condition number, when the problem to solve involves a non-linear algebra, for example when approximating irrational and transcendental functions or numbers with numerical methods.) If the condition number is close to one, the matrix is well conditioned which means its inverse can be computed with good accuracy. If the condition number is large, then the matrix is said to be ill-conditioned. Practically, such a matrix is almost singular, and the computation of its inverse, or solution of a linear system of equations is prone to large numerical errors. A matrix that is not invertible has the condition number equal to infinity. Other contexts Condition numbers can be defined for any function ƒ mapping its data from some domain (e.g. an m-tuple of real numbers x) into some codomain [e.g. an n-tuple of real numbers ƒ(x)], where both the domain and codomain are Banach spaces.  They express how sensitive that function is to small changes (or small errors) in its arguments.  This is crucial in assessing the sensitivity and potential accuracy difficulties of numerous computational problems, for example polynomial root finding or computing eigenvalues.  The condition number of ƒ at a point x (specifically, its relative condition number ) is then defined to be the maximum ratio of the fractional change in ƒ(x) to any fractional change in x, in the limit where the change δx in x becomes infinitesimally small: L.

For example, the set A = {2, 4, 6} contains 3 elements, and therefore A has a cardinality of 3. There are two approaches to cardinality – one which compares sets directly using bijections and injections, and another which uses cardinal numbers. The cardinality of a set A is usually denoted |\\u2009A\\u2009|, with a vertical bar on each side; this is the same notation as absolute value and the meaning depends on context. Alternatively, the cardinality of a set A may be denoted by n(A),  A , card(A), or #\\u2009A. Comparing sets Case 1: |\\u2009A\\u2009| = |\\u2009B\\u2009| Two sets A and B have the same cardinality if there exists a bijection, that is, an injective and surjective function, from A to B. For example, the set E = {0, 2, 4, 6, ...} of non-negative even numbers has the same cardinality as the set N = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} of natural numbers, since the function f(n) = 2n is a bijection from N to E. Case 2: |\\u2009A\\u2009| ≥ |\\u2009B\\u2009| A has cardinality greater than or equal to the cardinality of B if there exists an injective function from B into A. Case 3: |\\u2009A\\u2009| > |\\u2009B\\u2009| A has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of B if there is an injective function, but no bijective function, from B to A. For example, the set R of all real numbers has cardinality strictly greater than the cardinality of the set N of all natural numbers, because the inclusion map i : N → R is injective, but it can be shown that there does not exist a bijective function from N to R (see Cantor\\'s diagonal argument or Cantor\\'s first uncountability proof). Cardinal numbers Above, \"cardinality\" was defined functionally. That is, the \"cardinality\" of a set was not defined as a specific object itself. However, such an object can be defined as follows.The relation of having the same cardinality is called equinumerosity, and this is an equivalence relation on the class of all sets. The equivalence class of a set A under this relation then consists of all those sets which have the same cardinality as A. There are two ways to define the \"cardinality of a set\": The cardinality of a set A is defined as its equivalence class under equinumerosity. A representative set is designated for each equivalence class. The most common choice is the initial ordinal in that class. This is usually taken as the definition of cardinal number in axiomatic set theory. The cardinalities of the infinite sets are denoted  \\\\aleph_0   For each ordinal α,   α + 1  is the least cardinal number greater than   α .The cardinality of the natural numbers is denoted aleph-null (  0 ), while the cardinality of the real numbers is denoted by c, and is also referred to as the cardinality of the continuum. Cantor showed, using the diagonal argument, that c>  0 . We can show that c = 2   0  ; this also being the cardinality of the set of all subsets of the natural numbers. The continuum hypothesis says that   1  = 2   0  , i.e. 2   0   is the smallest cardinal number bigger than   0 , i.e. there is no set whose cardinality is strictly between that of the integers and that of the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis still remains unresolved in an \"absolute\" sense.  See below for more details on the cardinality of the continuum. Finite, countable and uncountable setsIf the axiom of choice holds, the law of trichotomy holds for cardinality. Thus we can make the following definitions: Any set X with cardinality less than that of the natural numbers, or |\\u2009X\\u2009|  0 , is said to be a countably infinite set. Any set X with cardinality greater than that of the natural numbers, or |\\u2009X\\u2009| > |\\u2009N\\u2009|, for example |\\u2009R\\u2009| = c > |\\u2009N\\u2009|, is said to be  uncountable. Infinite setsOur intuition gained from finite sets breaks down when dealing with infinite sets. In the late nineteenth century Georg Cantor, Gottlob Frege, Richard Dedekind and others rejected the view of Galileo (which derived from Euclid) that the whole cannot be the same size as the part. One example of this is Hilbert\\'s paradox of the Grand Hotel.The reason for this is that the various characterizations of what it means for set A to be larger than set B, or to be the same size as set B, which are all equivalent for finite sets, are no longer equivalent for infinite sets. Different characterizations can yield different results. For example, in the popular characterization of size chosen by Cantor, sometimes an infinite set A is larger (in that sense) than an infinite set B; while other characterizations  may yield that an infinite set A is always the same size as an infinite set B.For finite sets, counting is just forming a bijection (i.e., a one-to-one correspondence) between the set being counted and an initial segment of the positive integers. Thus there is no notion equivalent to counting for infinite sets. While counting gives a unique result when applied to a finite set, an infinite set may be placed into a one-to-one correspondence with many different ordinal numbers depending on how one chooses to \"count\" (order) it.Additionally, different characterizations of size, when extended to infinite sets, will break different \"rules\" which held for finite sets. Which rules are broken varies from characterization to characterization. For example, Cantor\\'s characterization, while preserving the rule that sometimes one set is larger than another, breaks the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller. Another characterization may preserve the rule that deleting an element makes the set smaller, but break another rule.  Furthermore, some characterization may not \"directly\" break a rule, but it may not \"directly\" uphold it either, in the sense that whichever is the case depends upon a controversial axiom such as the axiom of choice or the continuum hypothesis. Thus there are three possibilities. Each characterization will break some rules, uphold some others, and may be indecisive about some others.If one extends to multisets, further rules are broken (assuming Cantor\\'s approach), which hold for finite multisets. If we have two multisets A and B, A not being larger than B and B not being larger than A does not necessarily imply A has the same size as B.  This rule holds for multisets that are finite. Needless to say, the law of trichotomy is explicitly broken in this case, as opposed to the situation with sets, where it is equivalent to the axiom of choice.Dedekind simply defined an infinite set as one having the same size (in Cantor\\'s sense) as at least one of its proper parts; this notion of infinity is called Dedekind infinite. This definition only works in the presence of some form of the axiom of choice, however, so will not be considered to work by some mathematicians.Cantor introduced the above-mentioned cardinal numbers, and showed that (in Cantor\\'s sense) some infinite sets are greater than others. The smallest infinite cardinality is that of the natural numbers (  0 ). Cardinality of the continuum One of Cantor\\'s most important results was that the cardinality of the continuum ( \\\\mathfrak{c} ) is greater than that of the natural numbers (  0 ); that is, there are more real numbers R than whole numbers N. Namely, Cantor showed that  \\\\mathfrak{c} = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} > {\\\\aleph_0}  (see Cantor\\'s diagonal argument or Cantor\\'s first uncountability proof). The continuum hypothesis states that there is no cardinal number between the cardinality of the reals and the cardinality of the natural numbers, that is,  \\\\mathfrak{c} = \\\\aleph_1 = \\\\beth_1  (see Beth one). However, this hypothesis can neither be proved nor disproved within the widely accepted ZFC axiomatic set theory, if ZFC is consistent.Cardinal arithmetic can be used to show not only that the number of points in a real number line is equal to the number of points in any segment of that line, but that this is equal to the number of points on a plane and, indeed, in any finite-dimensional space. These results are highly counterintuitive, because they imply that there exist proper subsets and proper supersets of an infinite set S that have the same size as S, although S contains elements that do not belong to its subsets, and the supersets of S contain elements that are not included in it.The first of these results is apparent by considering, for instance, the tangent function, which provides a one-to-one correspondence between the interval (−½π, ½π) and R (see also Hilbert\\'s paradox of the Grand Hotel).The second result was first demonstrated by Cantor in 1878, but it became more apparent in 1890, when Giuseppe Peano introduced the space-filling curves, curved lines that twist and turn enough to fill the whole of any square, or cube, or hypercube, or finite-dimensional space. These curves are not a direct proof that a line has the same number of points as a finite-dimensional space, but they can be easily used to obtain such a proof.Cantor also showed that sets with cardinality strictly greater than  \\\\mathfrak c  exist (see his generalized diagonal argument and theorem). They include, for instance: the set of all subsets of R, i.e., the power set of R, written P(R) or 2 R  the set R R  of all functions from R to R Both have cardinality  2^\\\\mathfrak {c} = \\\\beth_2 > \\\\mathfrak c   (see Beth two). The cardinal equalities  \\\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\\\mathfrak{c},   \\\\mathfrak c^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak c,  and  \\\\mathfrak c ^{\\\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c}  can be demonstrated using cardinal arithmetic:  \\\\mathfrak{c}^2 = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^2 = 2^{2\\\\times{\\\\aleph_0}} = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak{c},   \\\\mathfrak c^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\aleph_0} = 2^  = 2^{\\\\aleph_0} = \\\\mathfrak{c},    \\\\mathfrak c ^{\\\\mathfrak c} = \\\\left(2^{\\\\aleph_0}\\\\right)^{\\\\mathfrak c} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c\\\\times\\\\aleph_0} = 2^{\\\\mathfrak c}.  Examples and properties If X = {a, b, c} and Y = {apples, oranges, peaches}, then |\\u2009X\\u2009| = |\\u2009Y\\u2009| because {(a, apples), (b, oranges), (c, peaches)} is a bijection between the sets X and Y. The cardinality of each of X and Y is 3. If |\\u2009X\\u2009|  \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\cup B \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\left\\\\vert A \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert B \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\,.  From this, one can show that in general the cardinalities of unions and  intersections are related by    \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\cup D \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\cap D \\\\right\\\\vert = \\\\left\\\\vert C \\\\right\\\\vert + \\\\left\\\\vert D \\\\right\\\\vert \\\\,.

A severe blizzard has winds over  , near zero visibility, and temperatures of −12 °C (10 °F) or lower.  A ground blizzard is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on  the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. DefinitionOfficially, the National Weather Service defines a blizzard as a severe snowstorm characterized by strong winds causing blowing snow that results in low visibilities.   The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to   with blowing or drifting snow which reduces visibility to 400 meters or a quarter mile or less and must last for a prolonged period of time — typically three hours or more.  Blizzards     While severe cold and large amounts of drifting snow may  accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring whiteout conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare. A severe blizzard has winds over  , near zero visibility, and temperatures of −12 °C (10 °F) or lower.   \"Blizzard\" Encyclopædia Britannica Online retrieved 17 March 2012   In Antarctica, blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of 160 km (about 100 miles) per hour. Ground blizzard refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface. The Australia Bureau of Meteorology describes a blizzard as, \"Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground.\"   Blizzard conditions of cold temperatures and strong winds can cause wind chill values that can result in hypothermia or frostbite.  The wind chill factor is the amount of cooling the human body feels due to the combination of wind and temperature. Blizzards in Australia Blizzards are not common in mainland Australia, but occur frequently in the Snowy Mountains in New South Wales and Victoria. When blizzards do occur, they can affect the Tasmanian Highlands and, particularly, Mount Wellington, which towers over the Tasmanian capital Hobart. Blizzards do not affect any major towns or cities, because there are no populated areas located in the mountains except for the ski resort towns of New South Wales and Victoria. United States storm systems In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the jet stream dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.    They are most common in the Great Plains, the Great Lakes states, and the northeastern states along the coast, and less common in the Pacific Northwest.When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the Rocky Mountains and the Great Plains, and warmer, moist air moves north from the Gulf of Mexico, all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the Texas panhandle to the Great Lakes.Another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the Hudson Bay area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and New England. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the Gulf of Mexico, strong surface winds, a lot of cold air advection, and extensive wintry precipitation occur.Low pressure systems moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the  Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in prairie, steppe and grassland, can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and  heavy snows and strong winds to the north.  With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and whiteout conditions.  In a true whiteout there is no visible horizon.  People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only 10 feet (3 meters) away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see. Nor\\'easter blizzards A nor\\'easter  is a macro-scale storm along the East Coast of the United States and Atlantic Canada; it gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of New England and Atlantic Canada. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a hurricane. More specifically it describes a low-pressure area whose center of rotation is just off the East Coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast.  High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion.  Notable nor\\'easters include The Great Blizzard of 1888, one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped 40-50\\xa0inches of snow and killed 400 people, mostly in New York. Historic events 1972 Iran blizzardThe 1972 Iran Blizzard, which caused approximately 4,000 deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history.  Dropping as much as 26 feet of snow, it completely covered 200 villages.  After a snowfall lasting nearly a week, an area the size of Wisconsin was entirely buried in snow.     The Snow Winter of 1880–1881The winter of 1880-1881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in the United States.  Many children—and their parents—learned of \"The Snow Winter\" through the children\\'s book The Long Winter by Laura Ingalls Wilder, in which the author tells of her family\\'s efforts to survive.   The snow arrived in October of 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March of 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the entire winter.  Accurate details in Wilder\\'s novel include the blizzards\\' frequency and the deep cold, the Chicago and North Western Railway stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her husband Almanzo and another man, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.  The October blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows. No one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested, their grain milled, or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place. By January the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort:  As soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line, a new storm arrived, filling up the line and leaving their work useless. There were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In the towns the streets were filled  with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was resorted to to secure passage about town. Homes and  barns were completely  covered, compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock.When the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded. Massive ice jams clogged the Missouri River and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged. Most of the town of Yankton, in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks.   The Storm of the CenturyThe Storm of the Century, also known as the Great Blizzard 1993, was a large cyclonic storm that formed over the Gulf of Mexico on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15.  It is unique for its intensity, massive size and wide-reaching effect.  At its height, the storm stretched from Canada towards Central America, but its main impact was on the Eastern United States and Cuba.  The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico, and then through the Eastern United States before moving into Canada.  Areas as far south as central Alabama and Georgia received   of snow and areas such as Birmingham, Alabama, received up to   with isolated reports of  . Even the Florida Panhandle reported up to  ,    with hurricane-force wind gusts and record low barometric pressures. Between Louisiana and Cuba, hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida, which along with scattered tornadoes killed dozens of people.  Record cold temperatures were seen across portions of the South and East in the wake of this storm.  In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of electric power to over 10\\xa0million customers. It is purported to have been directly experienced by nearly 40\\xa0percent of the country\\'s population at that time. A total of 310 people, including 10 from Cuba, perished during this storm.

To this day (2011), it is the worst blizzard in Chicago history. North American blizzard of 1947 was a record-breaking snowfall that began on Christmas day and brought the Northeast United States to a standstill. It  was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell steadily with drifts reaching ten feet.  Seventy-seven deaths were attributed to the blizzard.   Armistice Day Blizzard (November 12,1940) took place in the Midwest region of the United States on Armistice Day. This \"Panhandle hook\" winter storm cut a 1,000-mile-wide (1600\\xa0km) path through the middle of the country from Kansas to Michigan.  The morning of the storm was unseasonably warm but by mid afternoon conditions quickly deteriorated into a raging blizzard that would last into the next day.  A total of 145 deaths were blamed on the storm, almost a third of them duck hunters who had taken time off to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result the hunters were not dressed for cold weather.  When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the 50\\xa0mph (80\\xa0km/h) winds and 5-foot (1.5\\xa0m) waves overcame their encampments.  Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death in the single-digit temperatures that moved in over night.  Others tried to make it to shore and drowned. Great Lakes Storm of 1913 (November 7 through November 10) was the deadliest and most destructive natural disaster ever to hit the Great Lakes Basin in the Midwestern United States and the Canadian province of Ontario. Termed a \"November gale\", it produced 90\\xa0mph (145\\xa0km/h) wind gusts, waves over 35\\xa0feet (11\\xa0m) high, and whiteout snowsqualls. It killed more than 250 people,destroyed 19 ships, and stranded 19 others. Perhaps the most well-known ship to go down in a November gale was the SS Edmund Fitzgerald in 1975.  Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888, North American Great Plains.  What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people—including many schoolchildren—got caught in the blizzard. The death toll was 235.  Teachers generally kept children in their schoolrooms. Exceptions nearly always resulted in disaster.

Farmers Almanac List of Worst Blizzards in the United States United States Search and Rescue Task Force: About Blizzards A Historical Review On The Origin and Definition of the Word Blizzard Dr Richard Wild',6100: 'Chernobyl (city)   Chernobyl or Chornobyl ( ;  ,  ;  ,  )  is an abandoned city in the restricted Chernobyl Exclusion Zone situated in northern Kiev Oblast, Ukraine near the border with Belarus. The city had been the administrative centre of the Chernobyl Raion since 1932.The city was evacuated in 1986 due to the Chernobyl disaster at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant, located   north-northwest. The power plant was within Chernobyl Raion (District), but the city was not the residence of the power plant workers. When the power plant was under construction, Prypiat, a city larger and closer to the power plant, had been built as home for the power plant workers.After the accident the Chernobyl Raion administration was transferred to the neighboring Ivankiv Raion. Though the city today is mostly uninhabited, a small number of people reside in houses marked with signs stating that the \"Owner of this house lives here\". Workers on watch and administrative personnel of the Zone of Alienation are stationed in the city on a long term basis. Prior to its evacuation, the city was inhabited by about 14,000 residents.  The city of Slavutych was built specifically for the evacuated population of Chernobyl. Name originThe city name is the same as a local Ukrainian name for Artemisia vulgaris (mugwort or common wormwood), which is also чорнобиль \"chornobyl\".  An alternative etymology holds that it is a combination of the words chornyi (чорний, black) and byllia (билля, grass blades or stalks), hence it would literally mean black grass or black stalks. HistoryOriginally part of the land of Kievan Rus Chernobyl first appeared in a charter of 1193, described as a hunting-lodge of Knyaz Rostislavich. Norman Davies, Europe: A History, Oxford University Press, 1996, ISBN 0-19-820171-0   It was a crown village of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the 13th century. The village was granted as a fiefdom to Filon Kmita, a captain of the royal cavalry, in 1566. The province containing Chernobyl was transferred to the Kingdom of Poland in 1569, and then annexed by the Russian Empire in 1793. Davies, Norman (1995) \"Chernobyl\", The Sarmatian Review, vol. 15, No. 1.  Prior to the 20th century, Chernobyl was inhabited by Ukrainian and some Polish peasants, and a relatively large number of Jews.Chernobyl had a rich religious history. The Jews were brought by Filon Kmita, during the Polish campaign of colonization. The traditionally Christian Eastern Orthodox Ukrainian peasantry of the district was largely forced, by Poland, to convert to the Greek Catholic Uniate religion after 1596. Yet the vast majority returned to Eastern Orthodoxy after the Partitions of Poland.The Dominican church and monastery were founded in 1626 by Lukasz Sapieha, at the height of the Counter-reformation. There was a group of Old Catholics, who opposed the decrees of the Council of Trent. The Dominican monastery was sequestrated in 1832, following the failed Polish November Uprising, and the church of the Old Catholics was disbanded in 1852. In the second half of the 18th century, Chernobyl became one of the major centers of Hasidic Judaism. The Chernobyl Hasidic dynasty had been founded by Rabbi Menachem Nachum Twersky. The Jewish population suffered greatly from pogroms in October 1905 and in March–April 1919, when many Jews were killed and others were robbed, at the instigation of the Russian nationalist Black Hundreds. In 1920, the Twersky dynasty left Chernobyl, and it ceased to exist as a Hasidic centre.Since the 1880s, Chernobyl has seen many changes of fortune. In 1898 Chernobyl had a population of 10,800, including 7,200 Jews. In World War I the village was occupied, and in the ensuing Civil War, Chernobyl was fought over by Bolsheviks and Ukrainians. In the Polish-Soviet War of 1919–20, it was taken first by the Polish Army and then by cavalry of the Red Army. From 1921, it was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR. During the period 1929–33, Chernobyl suffered greatly from mass killings during Stalin\\'s collectivization campaign, and in the Holodomor (famine) that followed. The Polish community of Chernobyl was deported to Kazakhstan in 1936 during the Frontier Clearances. The Jewish community was murdered during the German occupation of 1941–44.  Twenty years later, the area was chosen as the site of the first nuclear power station on Ukrainian soil.The Duga-3 over-the-horizon radar array several miles out of Chernobyl was the origin of the infamous Russian Woodpecker, designed as part of Russia\\'s anti-ballistic missile early warning radar network.With the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Chernobyl remained part of Ukraine, now an independent nation.A small number of people continue to live in Chernobyl, having refused to leave their native city after the Chernobyl Disaster of 1986. Chernobyl nuclear reactor disaster   On April 26, 1986, Reactor #4 at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant near the town of Pripyat, Ukraine, exploded. The explosion took place at 1:23am while the neighboring town of Pripyat slept. Two workers were killed instantly. 40 hours later, the residents of Pripyat were ordered to evacuate, and most never returned; by that time, many of the residents had suffered varying degrees of radiation poisoning.In 2003, the United Nations Development Programme launched a project called the Chernobyl Recovery and Development Programme (CRDP) for the recovery of the affected areas.  The program launched its activities based on the Human Consequences of the Chernobyl Nuclear Accident report recommendations and was initiated in February 2002. The main goal of the CRDP\\'s activities is supporting the Government of Ukraine to mitigate long-term social, economic and ecological consequences of the Chernobyl catastrophe, among others. CRDP works in the four most Chernobyl-affected areas in Ukraine: Kiev Oblast, Zhytomyrska Oblast, partially Kiev, Chernihivska Oblast and Rivne Oblast. Chernobylite  Chernobylite is the name cited by two media sources   for highly radioactive, unusual and potentially novel crystalline formations found at the Chernobyl power plant after the explosion. These formations were found in the basement below Reactor #4 during an investigation into missing reactor fuel.

It was originally released in 1996. ArchitectureThe 6x86 is superscalar and superpipelined and performs register renaming, speculative execution, out-of-order execution, and data dependency removal. However, it continued to use native x86 execution and ordinary microcode only, like Centaur\\'s Winchip, unlike competitors Intel and AMD which introduced the method of dynamic translation to micro-operations with Pentium Pro and K5.With regard to internal caches, it has a 16-kB primary cache and is socket-compatible with the Intel P54C Pentium. It was also unique in that it was the only x86 design to incorporate a 256-byte Level 0 scratchpad cache. It has six performance levels: PR 90+, PR 120+, PR 133+, PR 150+, PR 166+ and PR 200+. These performance levels do not map to the clock speed of the chip itself (for example, a PR 133+ ran at 110\\xa0MHz, a PR 166+ ran at 133\\xa0MHz, etc.).The 6x86 and 6x86L weren\\'t completely compatible with the Intel P5 Pentium instruction set and is not multi-processor capable. For this reason, the chip identified itself as a 80486 and disabled the CPUID instruction by default. CPUID support could be enabled by first enabling extended CCR registers then setting bit 7 in CCR4. The lack of full P5 Pentium compatibility caused problems with some applications because programmers had begun to use P5 Pentium-specific instructions. Some companies released patches for their products to make them function on the 6x86.The first generation of 6x86 had heat problems. This was primarily caused by their higher heat output than other x86 CPUs of the day and, as such, computer builders sometimes did not equip them with adequate cooling. The CPUs topped out at around 25\\xa0W heat output (like the AMD K6), whereas the P5 Pentium produced around 15\\xa0W of waste heat at its peak. However, both numbers would be a fraction of the heat generated by many high performance processors, some years later. Revised cores The 6x86L (codename M1L) was later released by Cyrix to address heat issues; the L standing for low-power. Improved manufacturing technologies permitted usage of a lower Vcore. Just like the Pentium MMX the 6x86L required a split powerplane voltage regulator with separate voltages for I/O and CPU core. Another release of the 6x86, the 6x86MX, added MMX compatibility, introduced the EMMI instruction set, and quadrupled the primary cache size to 64\\xa0KB. Later revisions of this chip were renamed  MII, to better compete with the Pentium II processor. Performance It has been speculated by experts  that 6x86 was designed to perform well specifically on business-oriented benchmarks of the time, most notably Ziff-Davis\\' Winstone benchmark.  Winstone ran various speed tests using several popular applications. It was one of the leading benchmarks during the mid-\\'90s and was used in some leading magazines, such as Computer Shopper  and PC Magazine, as a deciding factor for system ratings.Cyrix used a PR rating (Performance Rating) to relate their performance to the Intel P5 Pentium (pre-P55C), because a 6x86 at a lower clock rate outperformed the higher-clocked P5 Pentium. For example, a 133\\xa0MHz 6x86 will outperform a P5 Pentium at 166\\xa0MHz, and as a result Cyrix could market the 133\\xa0MHz chip as being a P5 Pentium 166\\'s equal. A PR rating was also necessary because the 6x86 could not clock as high as P5 Pentium and maintain equivalent manufacturing yields, so it was critical to establish the slower clock speeds as equal in the minds of the consumer. However, the PR rating was not an entirely truthful representation of the 6x86\\'s performance.While the 6x86\\'s integer performance was significantly higher than P5 Pentium\\'s, its floating point performance was more mediocre—between 2 and 4 times the performance of the 486 FPU per clock cycle(depending on the operation and precision). The FPU in the 6x86 was largely the same circuitry that was developed for Cyrix\\'s earlier high performance 8087/80287/80387-compatible coprocessors, which was very fast for its time—the Cyrix FPU was much faster than the 80387, and even the 80486 FPU. However, it was still considerably slower than the new and completely redesigned P5 Pentium and P6 Pentium Pro-Pentium III FPUs. During the 6x86\\'s development, the majority of applications (office software as well as games) performed almost entirely integer operations. The designers foresaw that future applications would most likely maintain this instruction focus. So, to optimize the chip\\'s performance for what they believed to be the most likely application of the CPU, the integer execution resources received most of the transistor budget.The popularity of the P5 Pentium caused many software developers to hand-optimize code in assembly language, to take advantage of the P5 Pentium\\'s tightly pipelined and lower latency FPU. For example, the highly anticipated first person shooter Quake used highly-optimized assembly code designed almost entirely around the P5 Pentium\\'s FPU. As a result, the P5 Pentium significantly outperformed other CPUs in the game. Fortunately for the 6x86 (and AMD K6), many games continued to be integer-based throughout the chip\\'s lifetime. Cyrix MIIThe 6x86 successor—MII—was late to market, and couldn\\'t scale well in clock speed with the manufacturing processes used at the time. Similar to the AMD K5, the Cyrix 6x86 was a design far more focused on integer per-clock performance than clock scalability, something that proved to be a strategic mistake. Therefore, despite being very fast clock by clock, the 6x86 and MII were forced to compete at the low-end of the market as AMD K6 and Intel P6 Pentium II were always ahead on clock speed. The 6x86\\'s and MII\\'s old generation \"486 class\" floating point unit combined with an integer section that was at best on-par with the newer P6 and K6 chips meant that Cyrix could no longer compete in performance.

Cyrix M1 stats at Sandpile.org',4700: 'Bessel function In mathematics, Bessel functions, first defined by the mathematician Daniel Bernoulli and generalized by Friedrich Bessel, are canonical solutions y(x) of Bessel\\'s differential equation:  x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + (x^2 - \\\\alpha^2)y = 0  for an arbitrary real or complex number α (the order of the Bessel function); the most common and important cases are for α an integer or half-integer.Although α and −α produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two orders, so that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of α. Bessel functions are also known as cylinder functions or cylindrical harmonics because they are found in the solution to Laplace\\'s equation in cylindrical coordinates. Applications of Bessel functionsBessel\\'s equation arises when finding separable solutions to Laplace\\'s equation and the Helmholtz equation in cylindrical or spherical coordinates. Bessel functions are therefore especially important for many problems of wave propagation and static potentials. In solving problems in cylindrical coordinate systems, one obtains Bessel functions of integer order (α = n); in spherical problems, one obtains half-integer orders (α = n+1/2). For example: Electromagnetic waves in a cylindrical waveguide Heat conduction in a cylindrical object Modes of vibration of a thin circular (or annular) artificial membrane (such as a drum or other membranophone) Diffusion problems on a lattice Solutions to the radial Schrödinger equation (in spherical and cylindrical coordinates) for a free particle Solving for patterns of acoustical radiation Frequency-dependent friction in circular pipelines Bessel functions also have useful properties for other problems, such as signal processing (e.g., see FM synthesis, Kaiser window, or Bessel filter). DefinitionsSince this is a second-order differential equation, there must be two linearly independent solutions.  Depending upon the circumstances, however, various formulations of these solutions are convenient, and the different variations are described below. Bessel functions of the first kind : J α Bessel functions of the first kind, denoted as J α (x), are solutions of Bessel\\'s differential equation that are finite at the origin\\xa0(x\\xa0=\\xa00) for integer or positive α, and diverge as x approaches zero for negative non-integer\\xa0α. It is possible to define the function by its Taylor series expansion around x\\xa0=\\xa00:    J_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-1)^m}{m! \\\\, \\\\Gamma(m+\\\\alpha+1)} {\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)}^{2m+\\\\alpha}   where Γ(z) is the gamma function, a shifted generalization of the factorial function to non-integer values. The Bessel function of the first kind is an entire function if α is an integer. The graphs of Bessel functions look roughly like oscillating sine or cosine functions that decay proportionally to 1/√x (see also their asymptotic forms below), although their roots are not generally periodic, except asymptotically for large x. (The Taylor series indicates that −J 1 (x) is the derivative of J 0 (x), much like −sin(x) is the derivative of cos(x); more generally, the derivative of J n (x) can be expressed in terms of J n±1 (x) by the identities below.)For non-integer α, the functions J α (x) and J −α (x) are linearly independent, and are therefore the two solutions of the differential equation. On the other hand, for integer order α, the following relationship is valid (note that the Gamma function has simple poles at each of the non-positive integers):   J_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n J_{n}(x).\\\\,  This means that the two solutions are no longer linearly independent. In this case, the second linearly independent solution is then found to be the Bessel function of the second kind, as discussed below. Bessel\\'s integralsAnother definition of the Bessel function, for integer values of n, is possible using an integral representation:  J_n(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\cos (n \\\\tau - x \\\\sin(\\\\tau)) \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau.  Another integral representation is:  J_n (x) = \\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi} \\\\int_{-\\\\pi}^\\\\pi e^{-i(n \\\\tau - x \\\\sin(\\\\tau))} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\tau.  This was the approach that Bessel used, and from this definition he derived several properties of the function. The definition may be extended to non-integer orders by (for Re(x) > 0)  J_\\\\alpha(x) =   \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\tau- x \\\\sin\\\\tau)\\\\,d\\\\tau - \\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty  e^{-x \\\\sinh(t) - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt.        Relation to hypergeometric seriesThe Bessel functions can be expressed in terms of the generalized hypergeometric series as   J_\\\\alpha(x)=\\\\frac{(\\\\frac{x}{2})^\\\\alpha}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)}  \\\\;_0F_1 (\\\\alpha+1; -\\\\tfrac{x^2}{4}).  This expression is related to the development of Bessel functions in terms of the Bessel–Clifford function. Relation to Laguerre polynomialsIn terms of the Laguerre polynomials L k  and arbitrarily chosen parameter t, the Bessel function can be expressed as   \\\\frac{J_\\\\alpha(x)}{\\\\left( \\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)^\\\\alpha}= \\\\frac{e^{-t}}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)} \\\\sum_{k=0} \\\\frac{L_k^{(\\\\alpha)}\\\\left( \\\\frac{x^2}{4 t}\\\\right)}  \\\\frac{t^k}{k!}.  Bessel functions of the second kind : Y α The Bessel functions of the second kind, denoted by Y α (x), occasionally denoted instead by N α (x), are solutions of the Bessel differential equation that have a singularity at the origin (x = 0).  These are sometimes called Weber functions after Heinrich Martin Weber, and also Neumann functions after Carl Neumann.For non-integer α, Y α (x) is related to J α (x) by:  Y_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{J_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\pi) - J_{-\\\\alpha}(x)}{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}.  In the case of integer order n, the function is defined by taking the limit as a non-integer α tends to n:  Y_n(x) = \\\\lim_{\\\\alpha \\\\to n} Y_\\\\alpha(x).  There is also a corresponding integral formula (for Re(x) > 0),   Y_n(x) =\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\sin(x \\\\sin\\\\theta - n\\\\theta) \\\\, d\\\\theta - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi} \\\\int_0^\\\\infty  \\\\left[ e^{n t} + (-1)^n e^{-n t} \\\\right]  e^{-x \\\\sinh t} \\\\, dt.   Y α (x) is necessary as the second linearly independent solution of the Bessel\\'s equation when α is an integer. But Y α (x) has more meaning than that. It can be considered as a \\'natural\\' partner of J α (x). See also the subsection on Hankel functions below.When α is an integer, moreover, as was similarly the case for the functions of the first kind, the following relationship is valid:  Y_{-n}(x) = (-1)^n Y_n(x).\\\\,  Both J α (x) and Y α (x) are holomorphic functions of x on  the complex plane cut along the negative real axis.  When α is an integer, the Bessel functions J are entire functions of x.  If x is held fixed, then the Bessel functions are entire functions of α. Hankel functions: H α  (1) , H α  (2) Another important formulation of the two linearly independent solutions to Bessel\\'s equation are the Hankel functions H α  (1) (x) and H α  (2) (x), defined by:   H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(x) = J_\\\\alpha(x) + i Y_\\\\alpha(x)   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(x) = J_\\\\alpha(x) - i Y_\\\\alpha(x)  where i is the imaginary unit. These linear combinations are also known as Bessel functions of the third kind; they are two linearly independent solutions of Bessel\\'s differential equation. They are named after Hermann Hankel.The importance of Hankel functions of the first and second kind lies more in theoretical development rather than in application. These forms of linear combination satisfy numerous simple-looking properties, like asymptotic formulae or integral representations. Here, \\'simple\\' means  an appearance of the factor of the form e if(x) . The Bessel function of the second kind then can be thought to naturally appear as the imaginary part of the Hankel functions.The Hankel functions are used to express outward- and inward-propagating cylindrical wave solutions of the cylindrical wave equation, respectively (or vice versa, depending on the sign convention for the frequency).Using the previous relationships they can be expressed as:  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x) = \\\\frac{J_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} J_\\\\alpha (x)}{i \\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)}   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x) = \\\\frac{J_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - e^{\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} J_\\\\alpha (x)}{- i \\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)}.  If α is an integer, the limit has to be calculated. The following relationships are valid, whether α is an integer or not:   H_{-\\\\alpha}^{(1)} (x)= e^{\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x)    H_{-\\\\alpha}^{(2)} (x)= e^{-\\\\alpha \\\\pi i} H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x).   In particular, if α = m + 1/2 with m a nonnegative integer, the above relations imply directly that  J_{-(m+\\\\frac{1}{2})}(x) = (-1)^{m+1} Y_{m+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)    Y_{-(m+\\\\frac{1}{2})}(x) = (-1)^m J_{m+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x).   These are useful in developing the spherical Bessel functions (below).The Hankel functions admit the following integral representations for Re(x) > 0:   H_\\\\alpha^{(1)} (x)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty+i\\\\pi} e^{x\\\\sinh t - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt,    H_\\\\alpha^{(2)} (x)= -\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi i}\\\\int_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty-i\\\\pi} e^{x\\\\sinh t - \\\\alpha t} \\\\, dt,   where the integration limits indicate integration along a contour that can be chosen as follows: from −∞ to 0 along the negative real axis, from 0 to ±iπ along the imaginary axis, and from ±iπ to +∞±iπ along a contour parallel to the real axis. ===Modified Bessel functions : I α , K α ===  The Bessel functions are valid even for complex arguments x, and an important special case is that of a purely imaginary argument.  In this case, the solutions to the Bessel equation are called the modified Bessel functions (or occasionally the hyperbolic Bessel functions) of the first and second kind, and are defined by any of these equivalent alternatives:   I_\\\\alpha(x) = i^{-\\\\alpha} J_\\\\alpha(ix) =\\\\sum_{m=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{m! \\\\Gamma(m+\\\\alpha+1)}\\\\left(\\\\frac{x}{2}\\\\right)^{2m+\\\\alpha}   K_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} \\\\frac{I_{-\\\\alpha} (x) - I_\\\\alpha (x)}{\\\\sin (\\\\alpha \\\\pi)} = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} i^{\\\\alpha+1} H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(ix) = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2} (-i)^{\\\\alpha+1} H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(-ix).  These are chosen to be real-valued for real and positive arguments x. The series expansion for I α (x) is thus similar to that for J α (x), but without the alternating (−1) m  factor.We can express the first and second Bessel functions in terms of the modified Bessel functions (these are valid if −π  \\\\begin{align} J_\\\\alpha(iz) &=e^{\\\\frac{\\\\alpha i\\\\pi}{2}} I_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\\\\\ Y_\\\\alpha(iz) &=e^{\\\\frac{(\\\\alpha+1)i\\\\pi}{2}}I_\\\\alpha(z)-\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi}e^{-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha i\\\\pi}{2}}K_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\end{align} I α (x) and K α (x) are the two linearly independent solutions to the modified Bessel\\'s equation:   x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} - (x^2 + \\\\alpha^2)y = 0.  Unlike the ordinary Bessel functions, which are oscillating as functions of a real argument, I α  and K α  are exponentially growing and decaying functions, respectively.  Like the ordinary Bessel function J α , the function I α  goes to zero at x = 0 for α > 0 and is finite at x = 0 for α = 0.  Analogously, K α  diverges at x\\xa0=\\xa00.     Two integral formulas for the modified Bessel functions are (for Re(x) > 0):   I_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^\\\\pi \\\\exp(x\\\\cos(\\\\theta)) \\\\cos(\\\\alpha\\\\theta) d\\\\theta - \\\\frac{\\\\sin(\\\\alpha\\\\pi)}{\\\\pi}\\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp(-x\\\\cosh t - \\\\alpha t) dt ,   K_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\exp(-x\\\\cosh t) \\\\cosh(\\\\alpha t) dt.  Modified Bessel functions K 1/3  and K 2/3  can be represented in terms of rapidly converged integrals    \\\\begin{align} K_{\\\\frac{1}{3}} (\\\\xi) &= \\\\sqrt{3}\\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\, \\\\exp \\\\left[- \\\\xi \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4x^2}{3}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}} \\\\right] \\\\ dx \\\\\\\\ K_{\\\\frac{2}{3}} (\\\\xi) &= \\\\frac{1}{ \\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\, \\\\int_0^\\\\infty \\\\, \\\\frac{3+2x^2}{\\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}}} \\\\exp  \\\\left[- \\\\xi  \\\\left(1+\\\\frac{4x^2}{3}\\\\right) \\\\sqrt{1+\\\\frac{x^2}{3}} \\\\right] \\\\ dx \\\\end{align} The modified Bessel function of the second kind has also been called by the now-rare names: Basset function after Alfred Barnard Basset Modified Bessel function of the third kind Modified Hankel function  Macdonald function after Hector Munro Macdonald Weber function    Neumann function  Spherical Bessel functions: j n , y n  When solving the Helmholtz equation in spherical coordinates by separation of variables, the radial equation has the form:  x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + 2x \\\\frac{dy}{dx} + [x^2 - n(n+1)]y = 0.  The two linearly independent solutions to this equation are called the spherical Bessel functions j n  and y n , and are related to the ordinary Bessel functions  J n  and Y n  by:   j_{n}(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} J_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x),   y_{n}(x) = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} Y_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x) = (-1)^{n+1} \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2x}} J_{-n-\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x).  y n  is also denoted n n  or η n ; some authors call these functions the spherical Neumann functions.The spherical Bessel functions can also be written as (Rayleigh\\'s Formulas):   j_n(x) = (-x)^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} ,   y_n(x) = -(-x)^n \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{x}\\\\frac{d}{dx}\\\\right)^n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}.  The first spherical Bessel function j 0 (x) is also known as the (unnormalized) sinc function. The first few spherical Bessel functions are:  j_0(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x}   j_1(x)=\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x^2}- \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x}   j_2(x)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{3} {x^2} - 1 \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} - \\\\frac{3\\\\cos(x)} {x^2}    j_3(x)=\\\\left(\\\\frac{15}{x^3} - \\\\frac{6}{x} \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x} -\\\\left(\\\\frac{15}{x^2} - 1\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x},  and  y_0(x)=-j_{-1}(x)=-\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x}   y_1(x)=j_{-2}(x)=-\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)} {x^2}- \\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)} {x}   y_2(x)=-j_{-3}(x)=\\\\left(-\\\\,\\\\frac{3}{x^2}+1 \\\\right)\\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}- \\\\frac{3\\\\sin(x)} {x^2}    y_{3}\\\\left( x\\\\right)=j_{-4}(x) =\\\\left( -\\\\frac{15}{x^{3}}+\\\\frac{6}{x}\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\cos(x)}{x}-\\\\left( \\\\frac{15}{x^{2}}-1\\\\right) \\\\frac{\\\\sin(x)}{x}.  Generating functionThe spherical Bessel functions have the generating functions    \\\\frac 1 {z} \\\\cos \\\\left (\\\\sqrt{z^2 - 2zt} \\\\right )= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{t^n}{n!} j_{n-1}(z),    \\\\frac 1 {z} \\\\sin \\\\left ( \\\\sqrt{z^2 + 2zt} \\\\right )= \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{(-t)^n}{n!} y_{n-1}(z) .  Differential relationsIn the following f n  is any of  j_n, y_n, h_n^{(1)}, h_n^{(2)}  for  n=0,\\\\pm 1,\\\\pm 2,\\\\dots   \\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{z}\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\right)^m\\\\left(z^{n+1}f_n(z)\\\\right)=z^{(n-m)+1}f_{(n-m)}(z).   Spherical Hankel functions: h n  (1) , h n  (2) There are also spherical analogues of the Hankel functions:  h_n^{(1)}(x) = j_n(x) + i y_n(x) \\\\,    h_n^{(2)}(x) = j_n(x) - i y_n(x). \\\\,   In fact, there are simple closed-form expressions for the Bessel functions of half-integer order in terms of the standard trigonometric functions, and therefore for the spherical Bessel functions.  In particular, for non-negative integers n:  h_n^{(1)}(x) = (-i)^{n+1} \\\\frac{e^{ix}}{x} \\\\sum_{m=0}^n \\\\frac{i^m}{m!(2x)^m} \\\\frac{(n+m)!}{(n-m)!}  and  h_n^{(2)}  is the complex-conjugate of this (for real x). It follows, for example, that  j_0(x) = \\\\sin(x)/x  and  y_0(x) = -\\\\cos(x)/x , and so on.The spherical Hankel functions appear in problems involving spherical wave propagation, for example in the multipole expansion of the electromagnetic field. Riccati–Bessel functions: S n , C n , ξ n , ζ n Riccati–Bessel functions only slightly differ from spherical Bessel functions:  S_n(x)=x j_n(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, J_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)   C_n(x)=-x y_n(x)=-\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, Y_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}(x)   \\\\xi_n(x) = x h_n^{(1)}(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, H_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}^{(1)}(x)=S_n(x)-iC_n(x)   \\\\zeta_n(x)=x h_n^{(2)}(x)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{\\\\pi x}{2}} \\\\, H_{n+\\\\frac{1}{2}}^{(2)}(x)=S_n(x)+iC_n(x).  They satisfy the differential equation:  x^2 \\\\frac{d^2 y}{dx^2} + [x^2 - n (n+1)] y = 0.  This differential equation, and the Riccati–Bessel solutions, arises in the problem of scattering of electromagnetic waves by a sphere, known as Mie scattering after the first published solution by Mie (1908). See e.g., Du (2004)  for recent developments and references.Following Debye (1909), the notation  \\\\psi_n,\\\\chi_n  is sometimes used instead of  S_n,C_n . Asymptotic formsThe Bessel functions have the following asymptotic forms for non-negative α.  For small arguments  0  , one obtains: Arfken & Weber.   J_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\frac{1}{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha+1)} \\\\left( \\\\frac{z}{2} \\\\right) ^\\\\alpha    Y_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\begin{cases}  \\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi} \\\\left[ \\\\ln (z/2) + \\\\gamma \\\\right]  & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha=0 \\\\\\\\ \\\\\\\\   -\\\\frac{\\\\Gamma(\\\\alpha)}{\\\\pi} \\\\left( \\\\frac{2}{z} \\\\right) ^\\\\alpha & \\\\text{if } \\\\alpha > 0 \\\\end{cases}   where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant (0.5772...) and Γ denotes the gamma function. For large real arguments  x \\\\gg |\\\\alpha^2 - 1/4| , one cannot write a true asymptotic form for Bessel functions of the first and second kind (unless α is half-integer) because they have zeros all the way out to infinity which would have to be matched exactly by any asymptotic expansion. However, for a given value of arg(z) one can write an equation containing a term of order |z| −1 :   J_\\\\alpha(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\left(\\\\cos \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)+e^{|\\\\operatorname{Im}(z)|}O(|z|^{-1})\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }|\\\\arg z|   Y_\\\\alpha(z)=\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\left(\\\\sin \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)+e^{|\\\\operatorname{Im}(z)|}O(|z|^{-1})\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }|\\\\arg z|  (For α = 1/2 the last terms in these formulas drop out completely; see the spherical Bessel functions above.) Even though these equations are true, better approximations may be available for complex z. For example, J 0 (z) when z is near the negative real line is approximated better by  J_0(z)\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{-2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\cos \\\\left(z+\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)  than by  J_0(z)\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\cos \\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right) .The asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions are:  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(z)\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\exp\\\\left(i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(z)\\\\sim\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{2}{\\\\pi z}}\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)\\\\text{ for }-2\\\\pi  These can be extended to other values of arg(z) using equations relating  H_\\\\alpha^{(1)}(ze^{im\\\\pi})  and  H_\\\\alpha^{(2)}(ze^{im\\\\pi})  to H α  (1) (z) and H α  (2) (z).  It is interesting that although the Bessel function of the first kind is the average of the two Hankel functions, J α (z) is not asymptotic to the average of these two asymptotic forms when z is negative (because one or the other will not be correct there, depending on the arg(z) used). But the asymptotic forms for the Hankel functions permit us to write asymptotic forms for the Bessel functions of first and second kinds for complex (non-real) z so long as |z| goes to infinity at a constant phase angle arg z (using the square root having positive real part):  J_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left( i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   J_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }0   Y_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim-i\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left( i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }-\\\\pi   Y_\\\\alpha(z)\\\\sim-i\\\\frac{\\\\exp\\\\left(-i\\\\left(z-\\\\frac{\\\\alpha\\\\pi}{2}-\\\\frac{\\\\pi}{4}\\\\right)\\\\right)}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}}\\\\text{ for }0  For the modified Bessel functions, Hankel developed asymptotic expansions as well:  I_\\\\alpha(z) \\\\sim \\\\frac{e^z}{\\\\sqrt{2\\\\pi z}} \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 1}{8 z} + \\\\frac{(4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 1) (4 \\\\alpha^{2} - 9)}{2!

Another important relation for integer orders is the Jacobi–Anger expansion:  e^{iz \\\\cos(\\\\phi)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty i^n J_n(z) e^{in\\\\phi},\\\\!  and  e^{iz \\\\sin(\\\\phi)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty J_n(z) e^{in\\\\phi},\\\\!  which is used to expand a plane wave as a sum of cylindrical waves, or to find the Fourier series of a tone-modulated FM signal.More generally, a series  f(z)=a_0^\\\\nu J_\\\\nu (z)+ 2 \\\\cdot \\\\sum_{k=1} a_k^\\\\nu J_{\\\\nu+k}(z)\\\\!  is called Neumann expansion of ƒ. The coefficients for ν = 0 have the explicit form  a_k^0=\\\\frac{1}{2 \\\\pi i} \\\\int_{|z|=c} f(z) O_k(z) \\\\, \\\\mathrm d z,\\\\!  where O k  is Neumann\\'s polynomial. Selected functions admit the special representation  f(z)=\\\\sum_{k=0} a_k^\\\\nu J_{\\\\nu+2k}(z)\\\\!  with  a_k^\\\\nu=2(\\\\nu+2k) \\\\int_0^\\\\infty f(z) \\\\frac{J_{\\\\nu+2k}(z)}z  \\\\mathrm d z\\\\!  due to the orthogonality relation   \\\\int_0^\\\\infty J_\\\\alpha(z) J_\\\\beta(z) \\\\frac {\\\\mathrm d z} z= \\\\frac 2 \\\\pi \\\\frac{\\\\sin\\\\left(\\\\frac \\\\pi 2 (\\\\alpha-\\\\beta)  \\\\right)}{\\\\alpha^2 -\\\\beta^2}.  More generally, if ƒ has a branch-point near the origin of such a nature that   f(z)= \\\\sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\\\\nu+k}(z),   then  \\\\mathcal{L} \\\\left\\\\{\\\\sum_{k=0} a_k J_{\\\\nu+k} \\\\right\\\\}(s)= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{1+s^2}} \\\\sum_{k=0} \\\\frac{a_k}{(s+\\\\sqrt{1+s^2})^{\\\\nu+k}}  or  \\\\sum_{k=0} a_k \\\\xi^{\\\\nu+k}= \\\\frac{1+\\\\xi^2}{2\\\\xi} \\\\mathcal L \\\\{f \\\\} \\\\left( \\\\frac{1-\\\\xi^2}{2\\\\xi} \\\\right),  where  \\\\mathcal L \\\\{f \\\\}  is f \\' s Laplace transform. Another way to define the Bessel functions is the Poisson representation formula and the Mehler-Sonine formula:  \\\\begin{align}J_\\\\nu(z) &= \\\\frac{ (\\\\frac{z}{2})^\\\\nu }{ \\\\Gamma(\\\\nu + \\\\frac{1}{2} ) \\\\sqrt{\\\\pi} } \\\\int_{-1}^{1} e^{izs}(1 - s^2)^{\\\\nu - \\\\frac{1}{2} } ds, \\\\\\\\ &=\\\\frac 2  d u,\\\\end{align}  where ν > −1/2 and z ∈ C.  This formula is useful especially when working with Fourier transforms.The functions J α , Y α , H α  (1) , and H α  (2)  all satisfy the recurrence relations:  \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{x} Z_\\\\alpha(x) = Z_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) + Z_{\\\\alpha+1}(x)\\\\!    2\\\\frac{dZ_\\\\alpha}{dx} = Z_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) - Z_{\\\\alpha+1}(x)\\\\!  where Z denotes J, Y, H (1) , or H (2) .  (These two identities are often combined, e.g. added or subtracted, to yield various other relations.) In this way, for example, one can compute Bessel functions of higher orders (or higher derivatives) given the values at lower orders (or lower derivatives).  In particular, it follows that:  \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{x dx} \\\\right)^m \\\\left[ x^\\\\alpha Z_{\\\\alpha} (x) \\\\right] = x^{\\\\alpha - m} Z_{\\\\alpha - m} (x)   \\\\left( \\\\frac{d}{x dx} \\\\right)^m \\\\left[ \\\\frac{Z_\\\\alpha (x)}{x^\\\\alpha} \\\\right] = (-1)^m \\\\frac{Z_{\\\\alpha + m} (x)}{x^{\\\\alpha + m}}.  Modified Bessel functions follow similar relations :  e^{(\\\\frac{x}{2})(t+1/t)} = \\\\sum_{n=-\\\\infty}^\\\\infty I_n(x) t^n,\\\\!  and  e^{z \\\\cos( \\\\theta)} = I_0(z) + 2\\\\sum_{n=1}^\\\\infty  I_n(z) \\\\cos(n\\\\theta).\\\\!  The recurrence relation reads  C_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) - C_{\\\\alpha+1}(x) = \\\\frac{2\\\\alpha}{x} C_\\\\alpha(x)\\\\!   C_{\\\\alpha-1}(x) + C_{\\\\alpha+1}(x) = 2\\\\frac{dC_\\\\alpha}{dx}\\\\!  where C α  denotes I α  or e απi K α . These recurrence relations are useful for discrete diffusion problems.Because Bessel\\'s equation becomes Hermitian (self-adjoint) if it is divided by x, the solutions must satisfy an orthogonality relationship for appropriate boundary conditions.  In particular, it follows that:  \\\\int_0^1 x J_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,m}) J_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,n}) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\\\\alpha+1}(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [J_{\\\\alpha}\\'(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2,\\\\!  where α > −1, δ m,n  is the Kronecker delta, and u α, m  is the m-th zero of J α (x).  This orthogonality relation can then be used to extract the coefficients in the Fourier–Bessel series, where a function is expanded in the basis of the functions J α (x u α, m ) for fixed α and varying m.An analogous relationship for the spherical Bessel functions follows immediately:  \\\\int_0^1 x^2 j_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,m}) j_\\\\alpha(x u_{\\\\alpha,n}) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\delta_{m,n}}{2} [j_{\\\\alpha+1}(u_{\\\\alpha,m})]^2.\\\\!  Another orthogonality relation is the closure equation:   \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x J_\\\\alpha(ux) J_\\\\alpha(vx) dx = \\\\frac{1}{u} \\\\delta(u - v)\\\\!  for α > −1/2 and where δ is the Dirac delta function. This property is used to construct an arbitrary function from a series of Bessel functions by means of the Hankel transform. For the spherical Bessel functions the orthogonality relation is:  \\\\int_0^\\\\infty x^2 j_\\\\alpha(ux) j_\\\\alpha(vx) dx = \\\\frac{\\\\pi}{2u^2} \\\\delta(u - v)\\\\!  for α > −1.Another important property of Bessel\\'s equations, which follows from Abel\\'s identity, involves the Wronskian of the solutions:  A_\\\\alpha(x) \\\\frac{dB_\\\\alpha}{dx} - \\\\frac{dA_\\\\alpha}{dx} B_\\\\alpha(x) = \\\\frac{C_\\\\alpha}{x},\\\\!  where A α  and B α  are any two solutions of Bessel\\'s equation, and C α  is a constant independent of x (which depends on α and on the particular Bessel functions considered).  For example, if A α  = J α  and B α  = Y α , then C α  is 2/π.  This also holds for the modified Bessel functions; for example, if A α  = I α  and B α  = K α , then C α  is −1.(There are a large number of other known integrals and identities that are not reproduced here, but which can be found in the references.) Multiplication theoremThe Bessel functions obey a multiplication theorem  \\\\lambda^{-\\\\nu} J_\\\\nu (\\\\lambda z) = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty \\\\frac{1}{n!} \\\\left(\\\\frac{(1-\\\\lambda^2)z}{2}\\\\right)^n J_{\\\\nu+n}(z)   where λ and ν may be taken as arbitrary complex numbers. A similar form may be given for Y ν (z) and so on.   Bourget\\'s hypothesisBessel himself originally proved that for non-negative integers n, the equation J n (x) = 0 has an infinite number of solutions in x.   When the functions J n (x) are plotted on the same graph, though, none of the zeros seem to coincide for different values of n except for the zero at x = 0.  This phenomenon is known as Bourget\\'s hypothesis after the nineteenth century French mathematician who studied Bessel functions.  Specifically it states that for any integers n ≥ 0 and m ≥ 1, the functions J n (x) and J n+m (x) have no common zeros other than the one at x = 0.  The hypothesis was proved by Carl Ludwig Siegel in 1929.

A consumer may be a person or group, such as a household.  The concept of a consumer may vary significantly by context, although a common definition is an individual who buys products or services for personal use and not for manufacture or resale. Economics and marketingThe consumer is the one who pays to consume the goods and services produced. As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. In the absence of effective consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers. Typically, when business people and economists talk of consumers, they are talking about the person as consumer, an aggregated commodity item with little individuality other than that expressed in the decision to buy or not to buy. However, there is a trend in marketing to individualize the concept. Instead of generating broad demographic profiles and psycho-graphic profiles of market segments, marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing, permission marketing, and mass customization.      Law and politicsThe law primarily uses the notion of the consumer in relation to consumer protection laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users.   A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business.   As of all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection takes on a clear political significance.Concern over the interests of consumers has also spawned much activism, as well as incorporation of consumer education into school curricula.  There are also various non-profit publications, such as Consumer Reports and Choice Magazine, dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making, and Which? in the UK.In India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 clearly differentiates a consumer as consuming a commodity or service either for his personal domestic use or to earn his livelihood. Only consumers are protected as per this act and any person, entity or organization purchasing a commodity for commercial reasons are exempted from any benefits of this act.     Furthermore, Indian case law has quite a few references on how to distinguish a consumer from a customer.  Public reactionWhile use of the term consumer is widespread among governmental, business and media organisations, many individuals and groups find the label objectionable because it assigns a limited and passive role to their activities.

    "document_3_ld_output = {740: 'Allah\\tAllah (  or  ;    ,  ,  ) is the Arabic word for God (literally \"the God\", as the initial \"Al-\" is the definite article).    It is used mainly by Muslims to refer to the Islamic God,  Arab Christians, and often, albeit not exclusively, by Bahá\\'ís, Arabic-speakers, Indonesian, Malaysian and Maltese Christians, and Mizrahi Jews.  \"Allah.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica  Encyclopedia of the Modern Middle East and North Africa, Allah  Columbia Encyclopedia, Allah  Etymology The term Allāh is derived from a contraction of the Arabic definite article al- \"the\" and   \"deity, god\" to   meaning \"the [sole] deity, God\" ( , ho theos monos). L. Gardet, Allah, Encyclopaedia of Islam  Cognates of the name \"Allāh\" exist in other Semitic languages, including Hebrew and Aramaic. Columbia Encyclopaedia says: Derived from an old Semitic root referring to the Divine and used in the Canaanite El, the Mesopotamian ilu, and the biblical Elohim and Eloah, the word Allah is used by all Arabic-speaking Muslims, Christians, Jews, and other monotheists.  Biblical Hebrew mostly uses the plural form (but functional singular) Elohim. The corresponding Aramaic form is     in Biblical Aramaic and      in Syriac as used by the Assyrian Church, both meaning simply \"God\". The Comprehensive Aramaic Lexicon – Entry for    In the Sikh scriptures, Guru Granth Sahib, the term Allah ( ) is used 37 times. Guru Granth Sahib website (Search: ਅਲਹ|ਅਲਾਹ)  The name was previously  used by pagan Meccans as a reference to a creator deity, possibly the supreme deity in pre-Islamic Arabia. L. Gardet, \"Allah\", Encyclopedia of Islam     The concepts associated with the term Allah (as a deity) differ among religious traditions. In pre-Islamic Arabia amongst pagan Arabs, Allah was not considered the sole divinity, having associates and companions, sons and daughters–a concept that was deleted under the process of Islamization. In Islam, the name Allah is the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name, and all other divine names are believed to refer back to Allah.     Allah is unique, the only Deity, creator of the universe and omnipotent.   Arab Christians today use terms such as   ( , \"God the Father\") to distinguish their usage from Muslim usage.     There are both similarities and differences between the concept of God as portrayed in the Qur\\'an and the Hebrew Bible.  It has also been applied to certain living human beings as personifications of the term and concept.  Unicode has a codepoint reserved for Allāh,   = U+FDF2. Unicode Standard 5.0, p.479,492  Many Arabic type fonts feature special ligatures for Allah.  Arabic fonts and Mac OS X Programs for Arabic in Mac OS X  Usage in Arabic Pre-Islamic ArabiaIn pre-Islamic Arabia, Allah was used by Meccans as a reference to the creator-god, possibly the supreme deity.  Allah was not considered the sole divinity; however, Allah was considered the creator of the world and the giver of rain. The notion of the term may have been vague in the Meccan religion.  Allah was associated with companions, whom pre-Islamic Arabs considered as subordinate deities. Meccans held that a kind of kinship existed between Allah and the jinn.  Allah was thought to have had sons  and that the local deities of  , Manāt and al-Lāt were His daughters.  The Meccans possibly associated angels with Allah.   Allah was invoked in times of distress. Gerhard Böwering, God and his Attributes, Encyclopedia of the Qur\\'an   Muhammad\\'s father\\'s name was   meaning \"the slave of Allāh\".  Islam    According to Islamic belief, Allah is the proper name of God, Böwering, Gerhard, God and His Attributes, Encyclopaedia of the Qurʼān, Brill, 2007.  and humble submission to His Will, Divine Ordinances and Commandments is the pivot of the Muslim faith.  \"He is the only God, creator of the universe, and the judge of humankind.\" Britannica Concise Encyclopedia, Allah   \"He is unique ( ) and inherently one ( ), all-merciful and omnipotent.\"  The Qur\\'an declares \"the reality of Allah, His inaccessible mystery, His various names, and His actions on behalf of His creatures.\"  In Islamic tradition, there are 99 Names of God (  lit. meaning: \"The best names\") each of which evoke a distinct characteristic of Allah.     All these names refer to Allah, the supreme and all-comprehensive divine name.  Among the 99 names of God, the most famous and most frequent of these names are \"the Merciful\" (ar-raḥmān) and \"the Compassionate\" ( ).  Most Muslims use the untranslated Arabic phrase   (meaning \"God willing\") after references to future events.  Muslim discursive piety encourages beginning things with the invocation of   (meaning \"In the name of God\"). There are certain phrases in praise of God that are favored by Muslims, including \"Subhan-Allah\" (Holiness be to God), \"Alhamdulillah\" (Praise be to God),   (There is no deity but God) and \"Allāhu Akbar\" (God is great) as a devotional exercise of remembering God (zikr).  In a Sufi practice known as zikr Allah (lit. remembrance of God), the Sufi repeats and contemplates on the name Allah or other divine names while controlling his or her breath. Some scholars  have suggested that Muhammad used the term Allah in addressing both pagan Arabs and Jews or Christians in order to establish a common ground for the understanding of the name for God, a claim Gerhard Böwering says is doubtful.  According to Böwering, in contrast with pre-Islamic Arabian polytheism, God in Islam does not have associates and companions nor is there any kinship between God and jinn.  Pre-Islamic pagan Arabs believed in a blind, powerful, inexorable and insensible fate over which man had no control. This was replaced with the Islamic notion of a powerful but provident and merciful God. According to Francis Edwards Peters, \"The Qur\\'an insists, Muslims believe, and historians affirm that Muhammad and his followers worship the same God as the Jews ( ). The Koran\\'s Allah is the same Creator God who covenanted with Abraham\". Peters states that the Qur\\'an portrays Allah as both more powerful and more remote than Yahweh, and as a universal deity, unlike Yahweh who closely follows Israelites. F.E. Peters, Islam, p.4, Princeton University Press, 2003  ChristianityThe Aramaic word for \"God\" in the language of Assyrian Christians is  , or Alaha. Arabic-speakers of all Abrahamic faiths, including Christians and Jews, use the word \"Allah\" to mean \"God\".  The Christian Arabs of today have no other word for \"God\" than \"Allah\".  (Even the Arabic-descended Maltese language of Malta, whose population is almost entirely Roman Catholic, uses Alla for \"God\".) Arab Christians for example use terms   ( ) meaning God the Father,   ( ) mean God the Son, and   ( ) meaning God the Holy Spirit. (See God in Christianity for the Christian concept of God.)Arab Christians have used two forms of invocations that were affixed to the beginning of their written works. They adopted the Muslim  , and also created their own Trinitized   as early as the 8th century CE.  The Muslim   reads: \"In the name of God, the Compassionate, the Merciful.\" The Trinitized   reads: \"In the name of Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, One God.\" The Syriac, Latin and Greek invocations do not have the words \"One God\" at the end. This addition was made to emphasize the monotheistic aspect of Trinitian belief and also to make it more palatable to Muslims. Thomas E. Burman, Religious Polemic and the Intellectual History of the Mozarabs, Brill, 1994, p. 103 According to Marshall Hodgson, it seems that in the pre-Islamic times, some Arab Christians made pilgrimage to the Kaaba, a pagan temple at that time, honoring Allah there as God the Creator.  Judaism As Hebrew and Arabic are closely related Semitic languages, it is commonly accepted that Allah (root,  ) and the Biblical Elohim are cognate derivations of same origin, as in Eloah a Hebrew word which is used (e.g. in the Book of Job) to mean \"(the) God\" and also \"god or gods\" as in the case of Elohim, ultimately deriving from the root El, \"strong\", possibly genericized from El (deity), as in the Ugaritic lhm \"children of El\" (the ancient Near Eastern creator god in pre-Abrahamic tradition).In Jewish scripture Elohim is used as a descriptive title for the God of the scriptures whose name is YHWH, as well as for pagan gods. As a loanword English and other European languages  The history of the word \"Allāh\" in English was probably influenced by the study of comparative religion in the 19th century; for example, Thomas Carlyle (1840) sometimes used the term Allah but without any implication that Allah was anything different from God. However, in his biography of Muhammad (1934), Tor Andræ always used the term Allah, though he allows that this \"conception of God\" seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies. William Montgomery Watt, Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue, Routledge, 1983, p.45 Languages which may not commonly use the term Allah to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word. For example, because of the centuries long Muslim presence in the Iberian Peninsula, the word ojalá in the Spanish language and oxalá in the Portuguese language exist today, borrowed from Arabic (Arabic: إن شاء الله). This word literally means \"God willing\" (in the sense of \"I hope so\").  The German poet Mahlmann used the form \"Allah\" as the title of a poem about the ultimate deity, though it is unclear how much Islamic thought he intended to convey.  Some Muslims leave the name \"Allāh\" untranslated in English.  Malaysian and Indonesian languageChristians in Indonesia and Malaysia also use Allah to refer to God in the Malaysian language and Indonesian language (both languages forms of the Malay language which is referred to as Bahasa Melayu).Mainstream Bible translations  in both languages use Allah as the translation of Hebrew Elohim (translated in English Bibles as \"God\").  This goes back to early translation work by Francis Xavier in the 16th century.   The first dictionary of Dutch-Malay by A.C. Ruyl, Justus Heurnius, and Caspar Wiltens in 1650 (revised edition from 1623 edition and 1631 Latin-edition) recorded \"Allah\" as the translation of the Dutch word \"Godt\".  Ruyl also translated Matthew in 1612 to Malay language (first Bible translation to non-European language, only a year after King James Version was published  ), which was printed in the Netherlands in 1629. Then he translated Mark which was published in 1638.  The government of Malaysia in 2007 outlawed usage of the term Allah in any other but Muslim contexts, but the High Court in 2009 revoked the law, ruling that it was unconstitutional.  While Allah had been used for the Christian God in Malay for more than four centuries, the contemporary controversy was triggered by usage of Allah by the Roman Catholic newspaper The Herald. The government has in turn appealed the court ruling, and the High Court has suspended implementation of its verdict until the appeal is heard.

Bridgwater, W. & Beatrice Aldrich. (1966) The Columbia-Viking Desk Encyclopedia. Columbia University. p. 11. Its total length from its source to its junction with the Rhine comprises about 295  km (183 miles),  during which distance it descends  , draining an area of  , including the whole of central Switzerland. \"Aare River.\" Encyclopædia Britannica. 9 January 2007  Course The Aar rises in the great Aar Glaciers of the Bernese Alps, in the canton of Bern and west of the Grimsel Pass.  It runs east to the Grimsel Hospice, below the Finsteraarhorn, and then northwest through the Haslital, forming on the way the magnificent Handegg Waterfall,  , past Guttannen. Between Innertkirchen and Meiringen, the river carves through a limestone ridge in the Aar Gorge or Aareschlucht.  A little past Meiringen, near Brienz, the river expands into Lake Brienz. Near the west end of the lake it receives its first important tributary, the Lütschine. It then runs across the swampy plain of the Bödeli between Interlaken and Unterseen before flowing into Lake Thun. Near the west end of Lake Thun, the river receives the waters of the Kander, which has just been joined by the Simme. On flowing out of the lake it passes through Thun, and then flows through the city of Bern, passing beneath eighteen bridges and around the steeply-flanked peninsula on which the Old City is located. The river soon changes its northwesterly flow for a due westerly direction, but after receiving the Saane or Sarine it turns north until it nears Aarberg. There, in one of the major Swiss engineering feats of the 19th century, the Jura water correction, the river, which had previously rendered the countryside north of Bern a swampland through frequent flooding, was diverted by the Hagneck Canal into the Lake of Bienne. From the upper end of the lake the river issues through the Nidau-Büren channel and then runs east to Büren. The lake absorbs huge amounts of eroded gravel and snowmelt that the river brings from the Alps, and the former swamps have become fruitful plains: they are known as the \"vegetable garden of Switzerland\".From here the Aar flows northeast for a long distance, past the ambassador town Solothurn  (below which the Grosse Emme flows in on the right), Aarburg (where it is joined by the Wigger), Olten, Aarau,  near which is the junction with the Suhre, and Wildegg, where the Hallwiler Aa falls in on the right. A short distance further, below Brugg it receives first the Reuss, and shortly afterwards the Limmat. It now turns due north, and soon becomes itself a tributary of the Rhine, which it surpasses in volume when the two rivers unite at Koblenz (Switzerland), opposite Waldshut, Germany.  The Rhine, in turn, empties into the North Sea after crossing into the Netherlands.

Burning mirrors achieve a similar effect by using reflecting surfaces to focus the light. They were used in 18th-century chemical studies for burning materials in closed glass vessels where the products of combustion could be trapped for analysis. The burning glass was a useful contrivance in the days before electrical ignition was easily achieved. HistoryThe technology of the burning glass has been known since antiquity. Vases filled with water used to start fires were known in the ancient world, and metaphorical significance was drawn (by the early Church Fathers, for instance) from the fact that the water remained cool even though the light passing through it would set materials on fire. Burning lenses were used to cauterise wounds and to light sacred fires in temples. Plutarch refers to a burning mirror made of joined triangular metal mirrors installed at the temple of the Vestal Virgins. Aristophanes mentions the burning lens in his play The Clouds (424 BC). The perpetual sacred fire in the classic temples as the Olympic torch had to be pure and to come directly from the gods. For this they used the sun\\'s rays focused with mirrors or lenses and not impure triggers.Archimedes, the renowned mathematician, was said to have used a burning glass (or more likely a large number of angled hexagonal mirrors ) as a weapon in 212 BC, when Syracuse was besieged by Marcus Claudius Marcellus. The Roman fleet was supposedly incinerated, though eventually the city was taken and Archimedes was slain. The legend of Archimedes gave rise to a considerable amount of research on burning glasses and lenses until the late 17th century. Successful recreations have been performed by Anthemius of Tralles (6th century AD), Proclus (6th century) (who by this means purportedly destroyed the fleet of Vitellus besieging Constantinople), Ibn Sahl in his On Burning Mirrors and Lenses (10th century), Alhazen in his Book of Optics (1021),  Roger Bacon (13th century), Giambattista della Porta and his friends (16th century), Athanasius Kircher and Gaspar Schott (17th century), the Comte du Buffon in 1740 in Paris, Ioannis Sakas in the 1970s in Greece, and others. Sakas was able to ignite a wooden boat at some distance in only seconds. Buffon, using only 48 small mirrors, was able to melt a 3 kilogram (six pound) tin bottle, and ignite wood from a distance of 46 meters (150\\xa0ft). These recreations show the plausibility of Archimedes\\' achievement.The pop science TV program MythBusters attempted to model Archimedes\\' feat by using mirrors to ignite a small wooden boat covered with tar, with only partial success—they found it too difficult to focus light from their hand-held mirrors onto a point small enough to ignite the boat. However, an episode of Richard Hammond\\'s Engineering Connections relating to the Keck Observatory (whose reflector glass is based on the Archimedes\\' Mirror) did successfully use a much smaller curved mirror to burn a wooden model, though not made of the same quality of materials as in the MythBusters effort.Recent excavations at the Viking harbor town of Fröjel, Gotland in Sweden have revealed a small number of rock crystal lenses known as the Visby lenses.  These may have been made using pole-lathes. They have an imaging quality comparable to that of 1950s aspheric lenses. The Viking lenses effectively concentrate sunlight enough to ignite fires; however it is not known whether they were used for this purpose. Similar technology may have been used in ancient Ireland (the Liath Meisicith)  and quite possibly ancient Egypt. In 1796, during the French Revolution and three years after the declaration of war between France and Great Britain, Étienne-Gaspard Robert met with the French government and proposed the use of mirrors to burn the invading ships of the British Royal Navy.  They decided not to take up his proposal. Burns, Paul.  \"The History of The Discovery of Cinematography: Chapter Six 1750-1799\".  Accessed 29 July 2007. Chapter 17 of William Bates\\' 1920 book Perfect Sight Without Glasses, in which the author argues that observation of the sun is beneficial to those with poor vision, includes a figure of somebody \"Focussing the Rays of the Sun Upon the Eye of a Patient by Means of a Burning Glass.\"    Needless to say, this is highly dangerous and will damage the eye in seconds. Current useBurning glasses (often called fire lenses) are still used to light fires in outdoor and primitive settings.  Large burning lenses sometimes take the form of Fresnel lenses, similar to lighthouse lenses,     including those for use in solar furnaces.     Solar furnaces are used in industry to produce extremely high temperatures without the need for fuel or large supplies of electricity. They sometimes employ a large parabolic array of mirrors (some facilities are several storeys high) to focus light to a high intensity. The Olympic torch that is carried around the host country of the Olympic Games is lit by a burning glass, at the site of ancient Olympia in Greece.

However, the dispute over the Armenian Genocide and the recent war over Nagorno-Karabakh have created tense relations with two of its immediate neighbors, Azerbaijan and Turkey. Armenia is a member of more than 40 different international organizations including the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, NATO\\'s Partnership for Peace, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council, the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the World Trade Organization and La Francophonie. It is also an observer member of the Eurasian Economic Community and the Non-Aligned Movement. Eduard Nalbandyan currently serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs of Armenia. Armenian Genocide recognition  Parliaments of countries that recognize the Armenian genocide include Argentina, Armenia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Slovakia, Sweden,  Switzerland, Uruguay, Vatican City and Venezuela; additionally, some regional governments of countries recognize the Armenian genocide too, such as New South Wales in Australia and Wales in the United Kingdom. US House Resolution 106 was introduced on 30 January 2007, and later referred to the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. The bill currently has 225 co-sponsors.  The bill called for former President George W. Bush to recognize and use the word genocide in his annual 24 April speech which he never used. His successor President Barack Obama has expressed his desire to recognize the Armenian Genocide during the electoral campaigns, but after being elected, has not used the word genocide in his first annual 24 April speech in 2009. Disputes Nagorno-Karabakh/Azerbaijan  Armenia supports ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan in the longstanding and very bitter separatist conflict against the Azerbaijani Government.The current conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh (NK) began in 1988 when Armenian demonstrations against Azerbaijani rule broke out in both Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia and the Nagorno-Karabakh Supreme Soviet voted to secede from Azerbaijan and join Armenia. Soon, violence broke out against ethnic Azeris in Armenia and ethnic Armenians in Azerbaijan. In 1990, after violent episodes in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh, Baku and Sumgait, Moscow declared a state of emergency in Karabakh, sent troops to the region, and forcibly occupied Baku, killing over a hundred civilians. In April 1991, Azerbaijani militia and Soviet forces targeted Armenian paramilitaries operating in Karabakh. Moscow also deployed troops to Yerevan. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, conflict escalated into a full-scale war between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Military action was heavily influenced by the Russian military, which inspired and manipulated the rivalry between the two neighbouring nations in order to keep both under control.More than 30,000 people were killed in the fighting from 1992 to 1994. In May 1992, Armenian forces seized Shusha and Lachin (thereby linking Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia). By October 1993, Armenian forces succeeded in occupying almost all of former NKAO, Lachin and large areas in southwestern Azerbaijan. In 1993, the UN Security Council adopted four resolutions calling for the cessation of hostilities, unimpeded access for international humanitarian relief efforts, and the eventual deployment of a peacekeeping force in the region. Fighting continued, however, until May 1994 when Russia brokered a cease-fire.Negotiations to resolve the conflict peacefully have been ongoing since 1992 under the aegis of the Minsk Group of the OSCE. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by Russia, France, and the United States and has representation from Turkey, the U.S., several European nations, Armenia and Azerbaijan. Despite the 1994 cease-fire, sporadic violations, sniper-fire and landmine incidents continue to claim over 100 lives each year. Since 1997, the Minsk Group Co-Chairs have presented three proposals to serve as a framework for resolving the conflict. One side or the other rejected each of those proposals. Beginning in 1999, the Presidents of Azerbaijan and Armenia initiated a direct dialogue through a series of face-to-face meetings, often facilitated by the Minsk Group Co-Chairs. Most recently the OSCE sponsored a round of negotiations between the Presidents in Key West, Florida. U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell launched the talks on 3 April 2001, and the negotiations continued with mediation by the U.S., Russia and France until 6 April 2001. The Co-Chairs are continuing to work with the two Presidents in the hope of finding a lasting peace.The two countries are still technically at war.

Russia is the key regional security player, and has proved a valuable historical ally for Armenia. Although it appeared as a response to Aliyev\\'s US trip, the treaty had probably long been under development. However, it is clear from the wider context of Armenian foreign policy that—while Yerevan welcomes the Russian security guarantee—the country does not want to rely exclusively on Moscow, nor to become part of a confrontation between Russian and US-led alliances in the Transcaucasus.      2006-03-21 See Armenia–San Marino relations      1993-01-14 See Armenia–Serbia relations Armenia is represented in Serbia through its embassy in Athens (Greece).

Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs about relations with Armenia       No formal diplomatic relations See Armenia–Turkey relations Turkey was one of the first countries to recognize Armenia\\'s independence in 1991. Despite this, for most of the 20th century and early 21st century, relations remain tense and there are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries for numerous reasons. Some bones of contention include the unresolved Karabakh conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan (which has resulted in Turkey imposing a blockade on Armenia that is still in effect today), the treatment of Armenians in Turkey, the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, and the Armenian claim of Turkey\\'s holding of historic Armenian lands (ceded to them in the Treaty of Kars, a treaty which Armenia refuses to recognize to this day since it was signed between the Soviet Union and Turkey, and not between Armenia and Turkey proper). At the forefront of all disputes, however, is the issue surrounding the Armenian Genocide. The killing and deportation of between one and one-and-a-half million Armenians from eastern Anatolian lands of the Ottoman Empire orchestrated by the Young Turks is a taboo subject in Turkey itself as the Turkish government refuses to acknowledge that a genocide ever happened. However, since Turkey has become a candidate to join the European Union, limited discussion of the event is now taking place in Turkey. Some in the European Parliament have even suggested that one of the provisions for Turkey to join the E.U. should be the full recognition of the event as genocide. On 5 June 2005, Armenian President Robert Kocharian announced that he was ready to \"continue dialogue with Azerbaijan for the settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and with Turkey on establishing relations without any preconditions.\"  Armenia has also stated that as a legal successor to the Armenian SSR, it is loyal to the Treaty of Kars and all agreements inherited by the former Soviet Armenian government.  Yet Turkey continues to lay preconditions on relations, insisting that Armenia abandon its efforts to have the Genocide recognized, which official Yerevan is not willing to do. In the wake of the 2008 South Ossetia war between Russia and Georgia, Armenia and Turkey have shown signs of an inclination to reconsider their relationship. According to The Economist magazine, 70% of Armenia\\'s imports enter via Georgia. Because of the apparently belligerent posture of the Russian state, economic ties with Turkey appear especially attractive.       1992-12-25 See Armenia–Ukraine relations Armenian-Ukrainian relations have lasted for centuries and today are cordial.      1992-01-20 See Armenia–United Kingdom relations The United Kingdom recognised Armenia on 31 December 1991. The first Embassy of the Republic of Armenia in Europe was established in London in October 1992.  Since 1995, the United Kingdom has an embassy in Yerevan.  The two countries maintain collaborative and friendly relations, however the United Kingdom does not recognize the Armenian Genocide, as it considers that the evidence is not clear enough to respectively consider \"the terrible events that afflicted the Ottoman Armenian population at the beginning of the last century\" genocide under the 1948 UN convention. The British government states the \"massacres were an appalling tragedy\" and states that this was the view of the government during that period.  Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland consider it to be a genocide, and there is a memorial in Cardiff, Wales. British Foreign and Commonwealth Office about relations with Armenia   Asia Country Formal relations began Notes      No diplomatic relations See Armenia–Azerbaijan relations, Nagorno-Karabakh War, Khojaly Massacre, Khachkar destruction in Nakhchivan The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 (Armenian–Azerbaijani War) and in 1988–94 (Nagorno-Karabakh War), in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek. There are no formal diplomatic relations between the two countries, because of the of the ongoing Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and dispute.  The neighboring nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan have had formal governmental relations since 1918. The two nations have fought two wars in 1918–20 and in 1988–94 in the past century, with last one ended with provisional cease fire agreement signed in Bishkek.  During the Soviet period, many Armenians and Azeris lived side by side in peace. However, when Mikhail Gorbachev introduced the policies of Glasnost and Perestroika, the majority of Armenians from the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (NKAO) of the Azerbaijan SSR began a movement to unify with the Armenian SSR. In 1988, the Armenians of Karabakh voted to secede and join Armenia. This, along with sporadic massacres in Azerbaijan against Armenians resulted in the conflict that became known as the Nagorno-Karabakh War. The violence resulted in de facto Armenian control of former NKAO and seven surrounding Azerbaijani regions which was effectively halted when both sides agrees to observe a cease-fire which has been in effect since May 1994, and in late 1995 both also agreed to mediation of the OSCE Minsk Group. The Minsk Group is currently co-chaired by the U.S., France and Russia, and comprises Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, and several Western European nations. Despite the cease fire, up to 40 clashes are reported along the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict lines of control each year.  The two countries are still technically at war. Citizens of the Republic of Armenia, as well as citizens of any other country who are of Armenian descent, are forbidden entry to the Republic of Azerbaijan.  If a person\\'s passport shows any evidence of travel to Nagorno-Karabakh, they are forbidden to enter the Republic of Azerbaijan.  In 2008, in what became known as the 2008 Mardakert Skirmishes, Armenia and Azerbaijan clashed over Nagorno-Karabakh. The fighting between the two sides was brief, with few casualties on either side.         1992-03-18 See Armenia–Cyprus relations Cyprus was the second country to recognise the Armenian Genocide, on 24 April 1975. Armenia is represented in Cyprus through its embassy in Athens (Greece). Cyprus is represented in Armenia through its embassy in Moscow (Russia), and through an honorary consulate in Yerevan. There are over 3.500 people of Armenian descent living in Cyprus.  Vahan Ovanesyan of the Armenian Revolutionary Federation visited Cyprus on 24 January 2001 to take part in celebrations of the 110th anniversary of the federation.  Cyprus Foreign Ministry: list of bilateral treaties with Armenia       1992-07-17 See Armenia–Georgia relations Armenians and Georgians have a lot in common. Both are ancient Christian civilizations with their own distinct alphabets. Both use the terms \"Apostolic\" and \"Orthodox\" in the full titles of their respective churches. They also use the term \"Catholicos\" to refer to their church patriarchs. Despite all this, however, Armenians and Georgians have tended to have a tenuous relationship (at times, sharing close bonds while at other times regarding each other as rivals). Today, relations with Georgia are of particular importance for Armenia because, under the economic blockade imposed by Turkey and Azerbaijan due to the ongoing Karabakh conflict, Georgia offers Armenia its only land connection with Europe and access to its Black Sea ports. However, because of Armenia\\'s reliance on Russia and Georgia, both of whom fought the 2008 South Ossetia war and severed diplomatic and economic relations as a result; and as 70% of Armenia\\'s imports entered via Georgia especially from Russia which has imposed an economic blockade on Georgia, Armenia also has been indirectly affected from this blockade as well. The development of close relations between Turkey and Georgia (such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline and South Caucasus natural gas pipeline) have also weighed on the mutual relations and lead to the prevention of the country recognizing the Armenian Genocide. On occasion, however, Georgian politicians have sympathized with the Armenian cause. For example, on 20 March 2006, Georgian Ambassador to Armenia Revaz Gachechiladze stated, \"We sympathize with the sister nation but taking decisions of the kind we should take into account the international situation. When the time comes Georgia will do everything within the limits of the possible for the recognition of the Armenian Genocide by the international community including Georgia.\"  However, Armenian-Georgian relations have begun to improve. On 10 May 2006, Armenia and Georgia agreed on the greater part of the lines of the state border between the two countries.  The Javakheti region in southern Georgia contains a large Armenian population and although there have been local civic organizations (such as United Javakhk) pushing for autonomy, there has been no violence between Armenians and Georgians in the area.     1992-08-31 See Armenia–India relations Since 1999, Armenia has an embassy in New Delhi and 2 honorary consulates Mumbai, and Chennai.

See Armenia–Iran relations Despite religious and ideological differences, relations between Armenia and the Islamic Republic of Iran remain cordial and both Armenia and Iran are strategic partners in the region. Armenia and Iran enjoy cultural and historical ties that go back thousands of years. There are no border disputes between the two countries and the Christian Armenian minority in Iran enjoys official recognition. Of special importance is the cooperation in the field of energy security which lowers Armenia\\'s dependence on Russia and can in the future also supply Iranian gas to Europe through Georgia and the Black Sea.       See Armenia–Israel relations Since independence, Armenia has received support from Israel and today remains one of its major trade partners.

Lebanon is host to the eighth largest Armenian population in the world and is the only member of the Arab League, much less of the Middle East and the Islamic World that recognizes the Armenian Genocide. During the 2006 Lebanon War, Armenia announced that it would send humanitarian aid to Lebanon. According to the Armenian government, an unspecified amount of medicines, tents and fire-fighting equipment was allocated to Lebanese authorities on 27 July 2006.         See Armenia–Pakistan relations Armenia-Pakistan relations are extraordinarily poor owing to numerous disagreements. The main issue is Armenia\\'s invasion and occupation of Azerbaijan territories including Nagorno-Karabakh. Pakistan has supported territorial integrity of Azerbaijan during and after the Nagorno-Karabakh War. Pakistan also opposes Armenian irredentist claims against Turkey and Azerbaijan. Pakistan does not recognize the 1915 Genocide and maintains that during the war large number of Armenians and Muslims were killed. Armenia has friendly relations with India, and its recognition of Kashmir belonging to India has also damaged the relations with Pakistan. Pakistan is also the only country that does not recognize Armenia.   Pakistan has cultural, ethnic, historical and religious ties with Azerbaijan and Turkey. Pakistan has close military ties with Azerbaijan, trains Azerbaijani armed forces and plans to sell its JF-17 fighters to Azerbaijan.      1992-04-06 See Armenia–China relations China recognized Armenia on 21 December 1991.

Some have longer Italian versions that were edited for release abroad.  These films gathered popularity for both actors, especially in Europe.  The main dubber of Bud Spencer in Italy is Glauco Onorato who, with his characteristic voice, successfully enriched the character of Bud Spencer with many particularities. In some movies the dubber is Sergio Fiorentini (Botte di Natale, Al limite and the series of Detective Extralarge). In the movie Oggi a te domani a me the dubber is Ferruccio AmendolaSpencer also wrote the complete or partial screenplay for some of his movies. His fan base is particularly large in Europe. His feature film career slowed down after 1983, shifting more toward television. In the 1990s, he acted in the TV action-drama \"Extralarge\". Personal lifeAfter appearing in Più forte, ragazzi!, Spencer became a jet airplane and helicopter pilot.  He established Mistral Air in 1984, an air-mail company that also transports pilgrims, but later sold it to Poste Italiane to buy a textile mill that produced clothes for children. Career in politicsIn 2005, Pedersoli entered politics, unsuccessfully standing as regional counselor in Lazio for the Forza Italia party. Spencer has stated: \"In my life, I\\'ve done everything. There are only three things I haven\\'t been - a ballet dancer, a jockey and a politician. Given that the first two jobs are out of the question, I\\'ll throw myself into politics.\"  The opposition criticised him for engaging in \"politica spettacolo\" (\"showbiz politics\").  He worked for many years at the Italian Embassy in Brazil.

(founded in 1934 as National Allied Publications) is one of the largest and most successful companies operating in the market for American comic books and related media. It is the publishing unit of DC Entertainment,    a company of Warner Bros. Entertainment, which itself is owned by Time Warner. DC Comics produces material featuring a large number of well-known characters, including Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, the Flash, Aquaman, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Green Arrow, Black Canary and the Martian Manhunter, along with such superhero teams as the Justice League and the Teen Titans, as well as antagonists such as Lex Luthor, the Joker, Darkseid, the Riddler, Catwoman, Brainiac and the Penguin.The initials \"DC\" came from the company\\'s popular series Detective Comics, which featured Batman\\'s debut and subsequently became part of the company\\'s name.     Originally in Manhattan at 432 Fourth Avenue, the DC Comics offices have been located at 480 and later 575 Lexington Avenue; 909 Third Avenue; 75 Rockefeller Plaza; 666 Fifth Avenue; and 1325 Avenue of the Americas. DC has its headquarters at 1700 Broadway, Midtown Manhattan, New York City.  DC Comics Inc. Hoovers. Retrieved October 18, 2008.  Random House distributes DC Comics\\' books to the bookstore market, while Diamond Comic Distributors supplies the comics shop specialty market.  DC Comics and its major, longtime competitor Marvel Comics (owned by Time Warner\\'s main rival The Walt Disney Company since 2009) together shared over 80% of the American comic-book market in 2008.  History OriginsEntrepreneur Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson\\'s National Allied Publications    debuted with the tabloid-sized New Fun: The Big Comic Magazine #1 with a cover date of February 1934. New Fun #1 (Feb. 1935) at the Grand Comics Database. The entry notes that while the logo appears to be simply Fun, the indicia reads, \"New FUN is published monthly at 49 West 45th Street, New York, N.Y., by National Allied Publications, Inc.; Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson, President ... Inquiries concerning advertising should be addressed to the Advertising Manager, New FUN,....\"    The company\\'s second title, New Comics #1 (Dec. 1935), appeared in a size close to what would become comic books\\' standard during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, with slightly larger dimensions than today\\'s.  That title evolved into Adventure Comics, which continued through issue #503 in 1983, becoming one of the longest-running comic-book series.  In 2009 DC revived it with its original numbering.  Adventure Comics (DC, 2009 series) at the Grand Comics Database Wheeler-Nicholson\\'s third and final title, Detective Comics, advertised with a cover illustration dated December 1936, eventually premiered three months late with a March 1937 cover date. The themed anthology series would become a sensation with the introduction of Batman in issue #27 (May 1939). By then, however, Wheeler-Nicholson had gone. In 1937, in debt to printing-plant owner and magazine distributor Harry Donenfeld — who also published pulp magazines and operated as a principal in the magazine distributorship Independent News — Wheeler-Nicholson had to take Donenfeld on as a partner in order to publish Detective Comics #1. Detective Comics, Inc. was formed, with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz, Donenfeld\\'s accountant, listed as owners. Major Wheeler-Nicholson remained for a year, but cash-flow problems continued, and he was forced out. Shortly afterward, Detective Comics Inc. purchased the remains of National Allied, also known as Nicholson Publishing, at a bankruptcy auction. Detective Comics Inc. soon launched a fourth title, Action Comics, and the premiere of which introduced Superman (a character with which Wheeler-Nicholson had no direct involvement; editor Vin Sullivan chose to run the feature after Sheldon Mayer rescued it from the slush pile). Action Comics #1 (June 1938), the first comic book to feature the new character archetype — soon known as \"superheroes\" — proved a major sales hit. The company quickly introduced such other popular characters as the Sandman and Batman.On February 22, 2010, a copy of Action Comics #1 (June 1938) sold at auction from an anonymous seller to an anonymous buyer for $1 million, besting the $317,000 record for a comic book set by a different copy, in lesser condition, the previous year.  The Golden Age National Allied Publications soon merged with Detective Comics Inc. to form National Comics, which in 1944 absorbed an affiliated concern, Max Gaines\\' and Liebowitz\\' All-American Publications. That year, Gaines let Liebowitz buy him out, and kept only Picture Stories from the Bible as the foundation of his own new company, EC Comics. At that point, \"Liebowitz promptly orchestrated the merger of All-American and Detective Comics into National Comics... Next he took charge of organizing National Comics, [the self-distributorship] Independent News, and their affiliated firms into a single corporate entity, National Periodical Publications\".  National Periodical Publications became publicly traded on the stock market in 1961. Despite the official names \"National Comics\" and \"National Periodical Publications\", the line used the logo \"Superman-DC\" throughout (the DC logo could be seen on their covers and ads as early as 1940), and the company became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977. The company began to move aggressively against what it saw as copyright-violating imitations from other companies, such as Fox Comics\\' Wonder Man, which (according to court testimony) Fox started as a copy of Superman. This extended to DC suing Fawcett Comics over Captain Marvel, at the time comics\\' top-selling character. Despite the fact that parallels between Captain Marvel and Superman seemed more tenuous (Captain Marvel\\'s powers came from magic, unlike Superman\\'s), the courts ruled that substantial and deliberate copying of copyrighted material had occurred. Faced with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy if it lost, Fawcett capitulated in 1955 and ceased comics publication. Years later, Fawcett ironically sold the rights for Captain Marvel to DC — which in 1974 revived Captain Marvel in the new title Shazam! featuring artwork by his creator, C. C. Beck. In the meantime, the abandoned trademark had been seized by Marvel Comics in 1967, disallowing the DC comic itself to be called that. While Captain Marvel did not recapture his old popularity, he later appeared in a Saturday morning live action TV adaptation and gained a prominent place in the mainstream continuity DC calls the DC Universe.When the popularity of superheroes faded in the late 1940s, the company focused on such genres as science fiction, Westerns, humor, and romance. DC also published crime and horror titles, but relatively tame ones, and thus avoided the mid-1950s backlash against such comics. A handful of the most popular superhero-titles (most notably Action Comics and Detective Comics, the medium\\'s two longest-running titles) continued publication. The Silver Age In the mid-1950s, editorial director Irwin Donenfeld and publisher Liebowitz directed editor Julius Schwartz (whose roots lay in the science-fiction book market) to produce a one-shot Flash story in the try-out title Showcase. Instead of reviving the old character, Schwartz had writers Robert Kanigher and John Broome, penciler Carmine Infantino, and inker Joe Kubert create an entirely new super-speedster, updating and modernizing the Flash\\'s civilian identity, costume, and origin with a science-fiction bent. The Flash\\'s reimagining in Showcase #4 (October 1956) proved sufficiently popular that it soon led to a similar revamping of the Green Lantern character, the introduction of the modern all-star team Justice League of America (JLA), and many more superheroes, heralding what historians and fans call the Silver Age of comic books.National did not reimagine its continuing characters (primarily Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman), but radically overhauled them. The Superman family of titles, under editor Mort Weisinger, introduced such enduring characters as Supergirl, Bizarro, and Brainiac. The Batman titles, under editor Jack Schiff, introduced the successful Batwoman, Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite in an attempt to modernize the strip with non-science-fiction elements. Schwartz, together with artist Infantino, then revitalized Batman in what the company promoted as the \"New Look\", re-emphasizing Batman as a detective. Meanwhile, editor Kanigher successfully introduced a whole family of Wonder Woman characters having fantastic adventures in a mythological context.DC\\'s introduction of the reimagined superheroes did not go unnoticed by other comics companies. In 1961, with DC\\'s JLA as the specific spur,  Apocryphal legend has it that in 1961, either Jack Liebowitz or Irwin Donenfeld of DC Comics (then known as National Periodical Publications)  bragged about DC\\'s success with the Justice League (which had debuted in The Brave and the Bold #28 [February 1960] before going on to its own title) to publisher Martin Goodman (whose holdings included the nascent Marvel Comics) during a game of golf.However, film producer and comics historian Michael Uslan partly debunked the story in a letter published in Alter Ego #43 (December 2004), pp. 43–44: \"Irwin said he never played golf with Goodman, so the story is untrue. I heard this story more than a couple of times while sitting in the lunchroom at DC\\'s 909 Third Avenue and 75 Rockefeller Plaza office as Sol Harrison and [production chief] Jack Adler were schmoozing with some of us ... who worked for DC during our college summers.... [T]he way I heard the story from Sol was that Goodman was playing with one of the heads of Independent News, not DC Comics (though DC owned Independent News). ... As the distributor of DC Comics, this man certainly knew all the sales figures and was in the best position to tell this tidbit to Goodman. ... Of course, Goodman would want to be playing golf with this fellow and be in his good graces. ... Sol worked closely with Independent News\\' top management over the decades and would have gotten this story straight from the horse\\'s mouth.\" Goodman, a publishing trend-follower aware of the JLA\\'s strong sales, confirmably directed his comics editor, Stan Lee, to create a comic-book series about a team of superheroes. According to Lee in Origins of Marvel Comics (Simon and Schuster/Fireside Books, 1974), p. 16: \"Martin mentioned that he had noticed one of the titles published by National Comics seemed to be selling better than most. It was a book called The   Justice League of America and it was composed of a team of superheroes. ... \\' If the Justice League is selling \\', spoke he, \\'why don\\'t we put out a comic book that features a team of superheroes?\\'\"  Marvel Comics writer-editor Stan Lee and legendary creator Jack Kirby ushered in the sub-Silver Age \"Marvel Age\" of comics with the debut issue of The Fantastic Four. Since the 1940s, when Superman, Batman, and many of the company\\'s other heroes began appearing in stories together, DC\\'s characters inhabited a shared continuity that, decades later, was dubbed the \"DC Universe\" by fans. With the story \"Flash of Two Worlds\", in Flash #123 (September 1961), editor Schwartz (with writer Gardner Fox and artists Infantino and Joe Giella) introduced a concept that allowed slotting the 1930s and 1940s Golden Age heroes into this continuity via the explanation that they lived on an other-dimensional \"Earth 2\", as opposed to the modern heroes\\' \"Earth 1\" — in the process creating the foundation for what would later be called the DC Multiverse.A 1966 Batman TV show on the ABC network sparked a temporary spike in comic book sales, and a brief fad for superheroes in Saturday morning animation (Filmation created most of DC\\'s initial cartoons) and other media. DC significantly lightened the tone of many DC comics — particularly Batman and Detective Comics — to better complement the \"camp\" tone of the TV series. This tone coincided with the famous \"Go-Go Checks\" checkerboard cover-dress which featured a black-and-white checkerboard strip at the top of each comic, a misguided attempt by then-managing editor Irwin Donenfeld to make DC\\'s output \"stand out on the newsracks.\" In 1967, Batman artist Infantino (who had designed popular Silver Age characters Batgirl and the Phantom Stranger) rose from art director to become DC\\'s editorial director. With the growing popularity of upstart rival Marvel Comics threatening to topple DC from its longtime number-one position in the comics industry, he attempted to infuse the company with new titles and characters, also recruiting major talents such as ex-Marvel artist and Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko and promising newcomer Neal Adams. He also replaced some existing DC editors with artist-editors, including Joe Kubert and Dick Giordano, to give DC\\'s output a more artistic critical eye.These new editors recruited youthful new creators, in part in an effort to capture a market which had grown from being dominated by children, to include older teens and even college students. Some new talent, such as Dennis O\\'Neil, who had worked for both Marvel and Charlton, gained critical and popular acclaim on titles including Batman and Green Lantern (his Green Lantern run with artist Neal Adams became a key title in the burgeoning 1970s Bronze Age, and the move away from the Comics Code Authority). Nevertheless, the period was plagued by short-lived series that started out strong but petered out rapidly.In 1967, National Periodical Publications was purchased by Kinney National Company, which later purchased Warner Bros.-Seven Arts and became Warner Communications.  The Fourth World In 1970, Jack Kirby moved from Marvel Comics to DC, at the end of the Silver Age of Comics, in which Kirby\\'s contributions to Marvel played a large, integral role. Given carte blanche to write and illustrate his own stories, he created a handful of thematically linked series he called collectively The Fourth World. In the existing series Superman\\'s Pal Jimmy Olsen and in his own, newly launched series New Gods, Mister Miracle, and The Forever People, Kirby introduced such enduring characters and concepts as archvillain Darkseid and the otherdimensional realm Apokolips. While sales were respectable, they did not meet DC management\\'s initially high expectations, and also suffered from a lack of comprehension and internal support from Infantino. By 1973 the \"Fourth World\" was all cancelled, although Kirby\\'s conceptions would soon become integral to the broadening of the DC Universe. Kirby went on to create other \"daring and different\" series for DC, including Kamandi, about a teenaged boy in a post-apocalyptic world of anthropomorphic talking animals, when directed by the publisher to come up with something resembling Planet of the Apes. The Bronze Age Following the science-fiction innovations of the Silver Age, the comics of the 1970s and 1980s would become known as the Bronze Age, as fantasy gave way to more naturalistic and sometimes darker themes. Illegal drug use, banned by the Comics Code Authority, explicitly appeared in comics for the first time in Marvel Comics\\' The Amazing Spider-Man in early 1971, and after the Code\\'s updating in response, DC offered a drug-fueled storyline in writer Dennis O\\'Neil and artist Neal Adams\\' Green Lantern, beginning with the story \"Snowbirds Don\\'t Fly\" in the retitled Green Lantern / Green Arrow #85 (September 1971), which depicted Speedy, the teen sidekick of superhero archer Green Arrow, as having become a heroin addict.Jenette Kahn, a former children\\'s magazine publisher, replaced Infantino as editorial director in January 1976. DC had attempted to compete with the now-surging Marvel by dramatically increasing its output and attempting to win the market by flooding it. This included launching series featuring such new characters as Firestorm and Shade, the Changing Man, as well as an increasing array of non-superhero titles, in an attempt to recapture the pre-Wertham days of post-War comicdom. In June 1978, five months before the release of the first Superman movie, Kahn expanded the line further, increasing the number of titles and story pages, and raising the price from 35 cents to 50 cents. Most series received eight-page back-up features while some had full-length twenty-five page stories. This was a move the company called the \"DC Explosion\".  The move was not successful, however, and corporate partner Warner dramatically cut back on these largely unsuccessful titles, firing many staffers in what industry watchers dubbed \"the DC Implosion.\"  In September 1978, the line was dramatically reduced and standard-size books returned to 17 story pages but for a still-increased 40 cents.  By 1980, the books returned to 50 cents with a 25-page story count but the story pages replaced house ads in the books.Seeking new ways to boost market share, the new team of publisher Kahn, vice-president Paul Levitz, and managing editor Giordano addressed the issue of talent instability. To that end — and following the example of Atlas/Seaboard Comics and such independent companies as Eclipse Comics — DC began to offer royalties in place of the industry-standard work-for-hire agreement in which creators worked for a flat fee and signed away all rights, giving talent a financial incentive tied to the success of their work. In addition, emulating the era\\'s new television form, the miniseries while addressing the matter of an excessive number of ongoing titles fizzling out within a few issues of their start, DC created the industry concept of the comic book limited series.  This publishing format allowed for the deliberate creation of finite storylines within a more flexible publishing format that could showcase creations without forcing the talent into unsustainable openended commitments.These changes in policy shaped the future of the medium as a whole, and in the short term allowed DC to entice creators away from rival Marvel, and encourage stability on individual titles. In November 1980 DC launched the ongoing series The New Teen Titans, by writer Marv Wolfman and artist George Pérez, two popular talents with a history of success. Their superhero-team comic, superficially similar to Marvel\\'s ensemble series X-Men, but rooted in DC history, earned significant sales  in part due to the stability of the creative team, who both continued with the title for six full years. In addition, Wolfman and Pérez took advantage of the limited-series option to create a spin-off title, Tales of the New Teen Titans, to present origin stories of their original characters without having to break the narrative flow of the main series or oblige them to double their work load with another ongoing title. Late 1980s This successful revitalization of the Silver Age Teen Titans into The New Teen Titans led DC\\'s editors to seek the same for the entire line and for the wider DC Universe. The result, the Wolfman/Pérez 12-issue limited series Crisis on Infinite Earths, gave the company an opportunity to realign and jettison some of the \"baggage\" of its history, address \"errors\" in the characters\\' long histories and - particularly - revise, update and streamline major characters such as Superman and Wonder Woman. A companion publication in the new prestige format, two volumes entitled The History of the DC Universe, set out briefly the revised history of the major DC characters, and set the scene for an effective reboot of all titles, while still rooted in the long tradition and history of the DC Universe. Effectively moving from the realism of the Bronze Age towards the era sometimes called the \"Dark Age,\" Crisis featured many key and resonant deaths which would shape the DC Universe for the following decades, and separate the timeline of DC publications into pre- and post-\"Crisis\".Meanwhile, a parallel revolution had started in the non-superhero and horror titles. Since the start of 1984, British writer Alan Moore had re-energized the horror series The Saga of the Swamp Thing, and his acclaimed work sparked the comic-book equivalent of rock music\\'s British Invasion. Building on the dark naturalism of the Bronze Age, numerous British writers, including Neil Gaiman and Grant Morrison, subsequently began freelancing for the company. The resulting influx of sophisticated horror/fantasy material led not only to DC abandoning the Comics Code for particular titles scripted by those talents, but also to establishing in 1993 the Vertigo mature-readers imprint.Key titles in the subtle shift towards the Modern Age include the two DC-published limited series Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller and Watchmen by Moore and artist Dave Gibbons. These titles drew attention to changes at DC for their dark psychological complexity and promotion of the antihero. The new creative freedom and attendant publicity that allowed Miller to produce a dark, future Batman and Moore to create a similarly dystopian alternate history allowed DC to challenge Marvel\\'s industry lead. These titles also paved the way for comics to be more widely accepted in literary-criticism circles as suitable reading for adults, and to make inroads into the book industry, with collected editions of these key series selling particularly well as trade paperbacks.Conversely, while the mainstream DC Universe got a shade darker, the mid-1980s also saw the end of many long-running DC war comics, including venerable series that had been in print since the 1960s. These titles, all with over 100 issues, included Sgt. Rock, G.I. Combat, The Unknown Soldier, and Weird War Tales.In March 1989, Warner Communications merged with Time Inc., making DC Comics a subsidiary of Time Warner. In June, the first non-camp Batman movie was released, and DC began publishing its hardcover series of DC Archive Editions, collections of many of their early, key comics series, featuring rare and expensive stories unseen by many modern fans. Restoration for many of the Archive Editions was handled by Rick Keene with color restoration by DC\\'s long-time resident colorist, Bob LeRose. These collections attempted to retroactively credit many of the writers and artists who had worked without much recognition for DC during the early period of comics, when individual credits were few and far between. 1990sThe comics industry experienced a brief boom in the early 1990s, thanks to a combination of speculative purchasing (mass purchase of the books as collectible items, with intent to resell at a higher value as the rising value of older issues was thought to imply that all comics would rise dramatically in price) and several storylines which gained attention from the mainstream media. DC\\'s extended storylines in which Superman was killed, Batman was crippled, and superhero Green Lantern turned into the supervillain Parallax resulted in dramatically increased sales, but the increases were as temporary as the hero\\'s replacements. Sales dropped off as the industry went into a major slump, while manufactured \"collectibles\" numbering in the millions replaced quality with quantity until fans and speculators alike deserted the medium in droves. DC\\'s Piranha Press and other imprints (including the mature readers line Vertigo, and Helix, a short-lived science fiction imprint) were introduced to facilitate compartmentalized diversification and allow for specialized marketing of individual product lines. They increased the use of non-traditional contractual arrangements, including the dramatic rise of creator-owned projects, leading to a significant increase in critically lauded work (much of it for Vertigo) and the licensing of material from other companies. DC also increased publication of book-store friendly formats, including trade paperback collections of individual serial comics, as well as original graphic novels. DC entered into a publishing agreement with Milestone Media that gave DC a line of comics featuring a culturally and racially diverse range of superhero characters. Although the Milestone line ceased publication after a few years, it yielded the popular animated series Static Shock. DC established Paradox Press to publish material such as the large-format Big Book of... series of multi-artist interpretations on individual themes, and such crime fiction as the graphic novel Road to Perdition. In 1998, DC purchased Wildstorm Comics, Jim Lee\\'s imprint under the Image Comics banner, continuing it for many years as a wholly separate imprint - and fictional universe - with its own style and audience. As part of this purchase, DC also began to publish titles under the fledgling WildStorm sub-imprint America\\'s Best Comics (ABC), a series of titles created by Alan Moore, including The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Tom Strong, and Promethea. Moore strongly contested this situation, and DC eventually stopped publishing ABC. 2000sIn March 2003, DC acquired publishing and merchandising rights to the long-running fantasy series Elfquest, previously self-published by creators Wendy and Richard Pini under their WaRP Graphics publication banner. This series then followed another non-DC title, Tower Comics\\' series T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents, in collection into DC Archive Editions. In 2004, DC temporarily acquired the North American publishing rights to graphic novels from European publishers 2000 AD and Humanoids. It also rebranded its younger-audience titles with the mascot Johnny DC, and established the CMX imprint to reprint translated manga. In 2006, CMX took over from Dark Horse Comics publication of the webcomic Megatokyo in print form. DC also took advantage of the demise of Kitchen Sink Press and acquired the rights to much of the work of Will Eisner, such as his The Spirit series and his graphic novels.In 2004, DC began laying the groundwork for a full continuity-reshuffling sequel to Crisis on Infinite Earths, promising substantial changes to the DC Universe (and side-stepping the 1994 Zero Hour event which similarly tried to ret-con the history of the DCU). In 2005, the critically lauded Batman Begins film was released; also, the company published several limited series establishing increasingly escalated conflicts among DC\\'s heroes, with events climaxing in the Infinite Crisis limited series. Immediately after this event, DC\\'s ongoing series jumped forward a full year in their in-story continuity, as DC launched a weekly series, 52, to gradually fill in the missing time. Concurrently, DC lost the copyright to \"Superboy\" (while retaining the trademark) when the heirs of Jerry Siegel used a provision of the 1976 revision to the copyright law to regain ownership. In 2005, DC launched a new \"All-Star\" line (evoking the title of the 1940s publication), designed to feature some of the company\\'s best-known characters in stories that eschewed the long and convoluted continuity of the DC Universe, and were produced by \"all star\" creative teams. All-Star Batman & Robin the Boy Wonder launched in July 2005, with All-Star Superman beginning in November 2005. All Star Wonder Woman and All Star Batgirl were announced in 2006, with the release of Superman Returns in movie theaters, but neither have been released or scheduled as of the end of 2009. Adam Hughes, who was initially announced as the writer/artist on All Star Wonder Woman in 2006,   explained at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con International that that project was \"in the freezer\" for the time being, due to the difficulty involved in both writing and illustrating himself.  DC EntertainmentIn September 2009, Warner Bros. announced that DC Comics would become a subsidiary of DC Entertainment, Inc., with Diane Nelson, President of Warner Premiere, becoming president of the newly formed company and DC Comics President and Publisher Paul Levitz moving to the position of Contributing Editor and Overall Consultant there. Newsarama: Warner Bros. Creates DC ENTERTAINMENT To Maximize DC Brands. Retrieved on September 9, 2009.  On February 18, 2010, DC Entertainment named Jim Lee and Dan DiDio as Co-Publishers of DC Comics, Geoff Johns as Chief Creative Officer, John Rood as EVP of Sales, Marketing and Business Development, and Patrick Caldon as EVP of Finance and Administration.  In May 2011, DC announced it would begin releasing digital versions of their comics on the same day as paper versions.  2010s: Relaunch  On June 1, 2011, DC announced that it would end all ongoing series set in the DC Universe in August and relaunch its comic line with 52 issue #1s, starting with Justice League on August 31, 2011 (written by Geoff Johns and drawn by Jim Lee), with the rest to follow later on in September.   Logo  DC\\'s first logo appeared on the April 1940 issues of its titles. The letters \"DC\" stood for Detective Comics, the name of Batman\\'s flagship title. The small logo, with no background, read simply, \"A DC Publication.\"The November 1941 DC titles introduced an updated logo. This version was almost twice the size of the previous one, and was the first version with a white background. The name \"Superman\" was added to \"A DC Publication,\" effectively acknowledging both Superman and Batman. This logo was the first to occupy the top-left corner of the cover, where the logo has usually resided since. The company now referred to itself in its advertising as \"Superman-DC.\"In November 1949, the logo was modified to incorporate the company\\'s formal name, National Comics Publications. This logo would also serve as the round body of Johnny DC, DC\\'s mascot in the 1960s. In October 1970, DC briefly retired the circular logo in favor of a simple \"DC\" in a rectangle with the name of the title, or the star of the book; the logo on many issues of Action Comics, for example, read \"DC Superman.\" An image of the lead character either appeared above or below the rectangle. For books that did not have a single star, such as anthologies like House of Mystery or team series such as Justice League of America, the title and \"DC\" appeared in a stylized logo, such as a bat for \"House of Mystery.\" This use of characters as logos helped to establish the likenesses as trademarks, and was similar to Marvel\\'s contemporaneous use of characters as part of its cover branding.DC\\'s \"100 Page Super-Spectacular\" titles and later 100-page and \"Giant\" issues published from 1972 to 1974 featured a logo exclusive to these editions: the letters \"DC\" in a simple sans-serif typeface within a circle. A variant had the letters in a square. The July 1972 DC titles featured a new circular logo. The letters \"DC\" were rendered in a block-like typeface that would remain through later logo revisions until 2005. The title of the book usually appeared inside the circle, either above or below the letters.In December 1973, this logo was modified with the addition of the words \"The Line of DC Super-Stars\" and the star motif that would continue in later logos. This logo was placed in the top center of the cover from August 1975 to October 1976. When Jenette Kahn became DC\\'s publisher in late 1976, she commissioned graphic designer Milton Glaser to design a new logo. Popularly referred to as the \"DC bullet\", this logo premiered on the February 1977 titles. Although it varied in size and color and was at times cropped by the edges of the cover, or briefly rotated 4 degrees, it remained essentially unchanged for nearly three decades. Despite logo changes since 2005, the old \"DC bullet\" continues to be used only on the DC Archive Editions series. In July 1987, DC released variant editions of Justice League #3 and The Fury of Firestorm #61 with a new DC logo. It featured a picture of Superman in a circle surrounded by the words \"SUPERMAN COMICS\". The company released these variants to newsstands in certain markets as a marketing test. On May 8, 2005, a new logo was unveiled, debuting on DC titles in June 2005 with DC Special: The Return of Donna Troy #1 and the rest of the titles the following week. In addition to comics, it was designed for DC properties in other media, which was used for movies since Batman Begins, Superman Returns, and the TV series Smallville, Justice League Unlimited and The Batman, as well as for collectibles and other merchandise. The logo was designed by Josh Beatman of Brainchild Studios  and DC executive Richard Bruning. In January 2012, a new logo was unveiled and confirmed to \"re-capture the older branding.\" The Dark Knight Rises was the first film to use the new logo. The TV series Arrow also features the new logo.

As commissioner, he introduced competitive parity into the NFL to ameliorate the league\\'s commercial viability and enhance its popularity, and he assisted in making the NFL the most financially sound sport\\'s enterprise, and the dominant sports attraction, in the United States (US). He was posthumously enshrined into the charter class of the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Bell played football at the University of Pennsylvania, and as quarterback for the Quakers, he led his team to an appearance in the 1917 Rose Bowl. He was drafted into the US Army during World War I before ending his collegiate days at Penn and becoming an assistant football coach with the Quakers in the 1920s. During the Great Depression, he was an assistant coach for the Temple Owls and a co-founder and co-owner of the Philadelphia Eagles.With the Eagles, Bell convinced the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the first opportunity to sign the best available players. He subsequently became the sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the Eagles and bought a stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell auspiciously argued against the league suspending operations until the war\\'s conclusion.After the war, he was elected NFL commissioner and sold his ownership in the Steelers. As commissioner, he implemented a proactive anti-gambling agenda, negotiated a merger with the All-America Football Conference (AAFC), and unilaterally crafted the entire league schedule with an emphasis on augmenting the dramatic effect of late season matches. During the Golden Age of Television, he tailored the game\\'s rules to strengthen its appeal to mass media, and enforced a blackout policy of locally televised home contests to safeguard ticket receipts. Amidst criticism from franchise owners and under pressure from Congress, he unilaterally recognized the NFLPA and facilitated in the composing of the first pension plan for the players. His life would abide to oversee the \"Greatest Game Ever Played\" and to envision what the league would become in the future. Early life (1895–1932)Bell was born de Benneville Bell,  on February 25, 1895,  in Philadelphia to John C. Bell and Fleurette de Benneville Myers.  His father was an attorney who was elected the Pennsylvania Attorney General. Lyons: 3  His older brother, John C. Jr., was born in 1892.  Bert\\'s parents were very wealthy,  and his mother\\'s lineage predated the American Revolutionary War.  His father, a Quaker of the University of Pennsylvania (class of 1884) during the early days of American football,  accompanied him to his first football game when Bell was six years old. Sullivan: 23–24  Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends. Lyons: 3–4. In 1904, Bell matriculated at the Episcopal Academy, the Delancey School from 1909 to 1911 and then the Haverford School until 1914.  About this time, his father was installed as athletics director at Penn  and helped form the NCAA. Lyons: 2–3, 5.  At Haverford, Bell captained the school\\'s football, basketball, and baseball teams,  and \"was awarded The Yale Cup  [for being]  \\'The pupil who has done the most to promote athletics in the school.\\'\"    Although he excelled at baseball, his devotion was to football.  His father, who was named a trustee at Penn in 1911,  said of Bell\\'s plans for college, \"Bert will go to Penn or he will go to hell.\"  University of Pennsylvania (1914–1919) Bell entered Penn in the fall of 1914 as an English major and joined Phi Kappa Sigma. Lyons: 5–7   In a rare occurrence for a sophomore, he became the starting quarterback for Penn\\'s coach George H. Brooke.  On the team, he also was as a defender, punter, and punt returner.    After the team\\'s 3–0 start, Bell temporarily shared possession of his quarterbacking duties until he subsequently reclaimed them later in the season,  as Penn finished with a record of 3–5–2. MacCambridge 2009: 1080 Prior to Penn\\'s 1916 season, his mother died while he was en route to her bedside. Lyons:7-8  Nevertheless, he started the first game for the Quakers under new coach Bob Folwell, but mixed results left him platooned for the rest of the season.  Penn finished with a record of 7–2–1.  However, the Quakers secured an invitation to the 1917 Rose Bowl against the Oregon Ducks.  Although the best offensive gain for Penn during their 20-14 loss to Oregon was a 20 yard run by Bell, he was replaced late in the game at quarterback after throwing an interception. In the 1917 season, Bell led Penn to a 9–2–0 finish,  and afterwards, he registered with a Mobile Hospital Unit of the US Army for World War I and was deployed to France in May 1918. Lyons: 11–15  As a result of his unit participating in hazardous duty, it received a congratulatory letter for bravery from General John J. Pershing,  and Bell was promoted to top sergeant. Lyons: 16–20.  After the war ended, Bell arrived back in the United States in March 1919.  He returned to Penn as captain of the team in the fall and again performed erratically.  The Quakers finished 1919 with a 6–2–1 record.  Academically, his aversion to attending classes forced him to withdraw from Penn without a degree in early 1920.  His collegiate days ended with him having been a borderline All-American,  but this period of his life had proven that he \"possessed the qualities of a leader.\"  Early career (1920–1932)Bell assembled the Stanley Professionals in Chicago in 1920, but he disbanded it prior to playing any games because of negative publicity received by Chicago due the Black Sox Scandal.  He joined John Heisman\\'s staff at Penn as an assistant coach in 1920, and Bell would remain thereat for several years. Lyons: 22–23.  At Penn, he was well regarded as a football coach, and after its 1924 season, he drew offers for, but declined, head-coaching assignments at other universities.  At least as early as 1926, his avocation was socializing  and frequenting Saratoga Race Course, where he counted as friends Tim Mara, Art Rooney, and George Preston Marshall.  In 1928, Bell tendered his resignation at Penn in protest over the emphasis of in-season scrimmages during practices by Lud Wray, a fellow assistant coach. Lyons: 25–27  Bell\\'s resignation was accommodated prior to the start of the 1929 season. Bell was then an employee of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one ponit, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $ ) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. Lyons: 30-32  His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz.  From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team.  In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea.  When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and Bell was let go.  NFL career Philadelphia Eagles (1933–1940)By early 1933, Bell\\'s opinion on the NFL had changed, and he wanted to become an owner of a team based in Philadelphia. Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 56, 95.  However, college football games were provisioned for Saturdays, attracted a far greater attendance than NFL games,  and the Pennsylvania Blue Laws prohibited the patronizing of professional football on Sundays. Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95   After being advised a prerequisite to a franchise being rendered in Philadelphia was that the blue laws would have to be mollified, Westcott: 101; cf. Willis: 303–304, Algeo: 13–15, Ruck; Patterson, and Weber: 95  he was the force majeure to getting the laws deprecated.  He was then informed that any new franchise in Philadelphia would have to reimburse the arrears owed by the Frankford Yellow Jackets.  Bell, thereabouts, partnered with Wray, Lyons: 46–47; cf. Claassen: 336, MacCambridge 2005: 42, Peterson: 112, Westcott: 101  and they conceded to guarantee Frankford\\'s debt. Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 28  However, they needed more capital to pay the  league entrance fee, pay off the debt of the Yellow Jackets, and assemble a team.  Bell attempted to persuade his father to lend him money, but his father deplored football as a livelihood and would not abet him.  Consequently, Bell borrowed funds from Frances Upton, and he procured the rights to a franchise in Philadelphia,  became its president,  and christened the team the Philadelphia Eagles  After the inaugural 1933 Philadelphia Eagles season,  Bell married Upton at St. Madeleine Sophie Roman Catholic Church in Philadelphia.  Days later, his suggestion to bestow the winner of the NFL championship game with the Ed Thorp Memorial Trophy was affirmed.  In 1934, the Eagles finished with a 4–7 record,  The Eagles\\' inability to seriously challenge other teams made it difficult to sell tickets,  and his failure to sign a talented college prospect  led him to adduce that the only way to bring stability to the league was to institute a draft to ensure the weakest teams had an advantage in signing the preeminent players.  In 1935, his proposal for a draft was accepted,  and in February 1936, the first draft kicked off, at which he acted as Master of Ceremonies.  Later that month, his first child, Bert Jr., was born. In the Eagles\\' first three years, the partners exhausted $85,000 (presently, $ ),  and at a public auction, Bell became sole owner of the Eagles with a bid of $4,500 (presently, $ ).  Austerity measures forced him to supplant Wray as head coach of the Eagles,  wherein Bell led the Eagles to an 1–11 finish, their worst record ever (as of the   season).  In December, an application for a franchise in Los Angeles was obstructed by Bell and Pittsburgh Steelers owner Rooney as they deemed it too far of a distance to travel for games. During the Eagles\\' 2-8-1 1937 season,  his second child, John \"Upton\", was born.  In the Eagles\\' first profitable season, 1938, they posted a 5–6 record.  The Eagles finished 1–9–1 in 1939 and 1–10 in 1940.  Pittsburgh Steelers (1940–1945)In December 1940, Bell conciliated the sale of Rooney\\'s Steelers to Alexis Thompson, Algeo: 16  and then Rooney acquired half of Bell\\'s interest in the Eagles.  In a series of events known as the Pennsylvania Polka,  Rooney and Bell exchanged their entire Eagles roster and their territorial rights in Philadelphia to Thompson for his entire Steelers roster and his rights in Pittsburgh.  Ostensibly, Rooney had provided assistance to Bell by rewarding him with a 20% commission on the sale of the Steelers.  Bell became the Steelers head coach and Rooney became the general manager. During the training camp of the Pittsburgh\\'s inaugural season with the nickname Steelers, Bell was buoyant with optimism about the team\\'s prospect, but he became crestfallen after Rooney denigrated the squad and flippantly remarked that they looked like the \"[s]ame old Steelers\" (SOS).  After losing the first two games of the 1941 season, Rooney compelled Bell into resigning as head coach.  Bell\\'s coaching career ended with a 10–46–2 record, and for coaches with at least five years in the NFL, it is the worst record ever (as of the 2012 season).  His first daughter and last child, Jane Upton, was born several months after the season\\'s conclusion. By 1943, 40% of the NFL rosters had been drafted into the United States Armed Forces for World War II.  The resulting difficulty in fielding a full-strength squad led some owners to recommend the league should shut down until the war ended. Bell auspiciously argued against this as he feared they might not be able to resume operations easily after the war, and since Major League Baseball was continuing unabated, then they should also. Throughout Bell\\'s affiliation with the Steelers, he suffered monetarily and Rooney bought an increasing allotment of the franchise from him.  Compounding Bell\\'s problems, Arch Ward organized the All-American Football Conference (AAFC) in 1944 to displace the NFL\\'s sovereignty in professional football.  Ward\\'s AAFC promptly began luring players to join the league,  which resulted in salaries being driven up drastically.  In Bill Dudley\\'s contract proceedings with the Steelers, he attributed Bell\\'s anxiety during the negotiations to the rivalry from the AAFC.  Furthermore, by the end of 1945, the Steelers were in their most economically perilous situation in its history.  NFL commissioner (1946–1959) Election, Hapes-Filchock, and the NFL schedule (1946–1948)Elmer Layden was appointed the first NFL commissioner in 1941, but Ward appeared as dictating his hiring.  Layden tendered his resignation for personal reasons January 1946.  Bell, who was not well respected in Pittsburgh,  was elected to replace him.  He received a three-year contract at $20,000 ($ ) per year,  and transacted a sale of his stake in the Steelers to Rooney,  albeit for a price Bell did not construe was full-value. Lyons: 166–167  He was then immediately placed at the center of a controversy wherein the owners denied Dan Reeves permission to relocate the Cleveland Rams to Los Angeles. MacCambridge 2005: 15–16; cf. Davis 2005: 201–202, Yost: 57–58: Lyons: 117–118  Bell moderated a settlement, and, as a result, the Los Angeles Rams were formed.  As a precondition to the Rams leasing the Los Angeles Coliseum, they signed Kenny Washington, which marked the beginning of the end of racial segregation on the field, but also caused \"\\'all hell to break loose\\'\" amidst the owners.  The drawing up of a regular season schedule had been a perennial source of contention among the NFL owners since the league\\'s inception.  The crux of the problem was the scheduling of games meant weighing the interest of owners who, early in the season, wanted their franchises to confront teams that drew the largest crowds, versus owners who wanted to play the weaker franchises to pad their team\\'s win-loss record.  The resultant impasse coerced the owners, in 1946, to confer upon Bell the sole discretion in developing the league\\'s schedule.  He utilized this responsibility to, early in the season, pit the weaker teams against other weak teams, and the strong teams against other strong teams. Sullivan: 26; Ruck; Patterson and Weber: 248  His goal was to augment game attendances by keeping the difference in team standings to a minimum as deep into the season as possible. On the eve of the 1946 championship game, Bell was notified that Merle Hapes and Frank Filchock of the New York Giants had been implicated in a bribing scandal.  Filchock was sanctioned by Bell to play in the game but Hapes was suspended.  At the next NFL owners\\' meeting, Bell was worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing.    However he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Lyons: 129  Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs. Subsequently, he wrote an anti-gambling resolution into the league constitution,  which empowered him with the ability to permanently ban any NFL associated personnel for betting on a game or for withholding information on a game being possibly fixed.  Furthermore, to obstruct gamblers from getting inside information, he secreted the names of officials he would assign to games,  and he directed each team to promulgate a precursory injury report which listed anyone who might not participate in a game.  Eventually, he lobbied to get every state in the US to criminalize the fixing of sporting events Lyons: 142  and put employees on the payroll of the NFL to investigate potential betting scams.  AAFC-NFL merger (1948–1950)The NFL\\'s struggle against the AAFC generated stress on wages,  attendance,  marketing,  and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL for showing a profit for three consecutive years.  Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless.  In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had a negative impact on the sale of home tickets.  Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL\\'s first television contract —the 1949 championship game.  Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC.  Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell. One of the primary impediments in an AAFC-NFL merger was the supposed violation of \"territorial rights\" claimed by Marshall.   Eventually, Bell gathered enough support to effectuate a compromise with the AAFC.  In late 1949, the leagues merged, Lyons: 150, 163; cf. MacCambridge 2005: 52  and Bell would stay on as commissioner  with his contract extended from five to ten years  as three AAFC teams (the Cleveland Browns, San Francisco 49ers, and Baltimore Colts) were subsumed.  Seeking to capitalize on the publicity of the residual rivalry, he utilized \"exquisite dramatic\" and business sense and allocated the 1950 opening game to a contest between the 1949 champion Eagles versus the perennial AAFC champion Browns.  Feeling financially secure after the merger, he purchased his first home for himself and his family in Narberth, Pennsylvania.  Marketing of the NFL (1950–1956)In 1950, Bell originated a blackout rule into the NFL which forbid all teams to televise their home games within a 75 mile radius of their stadium - except for the Rams.   Consequently, the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) opened an investigation into a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act.  Ensuingly, the Rams attendance for 1950 dropped off by 50%,  and this signaled a potential financial disaster.  In 1951, he licensed the DuMont Television Network to air the championship games for the next five years, and he stipulated that teams were free to develop their own television contracts independently. However, preceding 1951 season, he reimposed the blackout rule on all teams in the league.  The DOJ filed suit over this and Bell publicly retorted, \"You can\\'t give fans a game for free on TV and also expect them to go to the ballpark\"; nevertheless, the suit was ordered to trial for January 1952.  After the 1951 season ended, he gained unilateral control over the setting of a television strategy for the NFL.  He negotiated a deal with DuMont, which granted it the rights to nationally broadcast one regular season game every week,   and he directed that the income from this contract was to be shared equally between all the teams.  In the DOJ\\'s case, the judge ruled that the blackout policy was legal, but both Bell, and the franchises collectively, were enjoined from negotiating a TV contract;  Bell was ecstatic.  Later that year, Bell forced one of the owners of the Cleveland Browns to sell all of his shares in the team after Bell determined the owner had bet on Browns\\' football games.  Although he hated to fly,  at some indeterminate point, he visited the training camps of every team and lectured on the danger gamblers posed to the league. Bell authorized a Pro Bowl to be held at the end of each season in order to showcase the talents of the best players.  But in the early 1950s, on the field activities sometimes denigrated to borderline assault and battery  with teams\\' star players being viciously targeted by opposing players.  He answered charges the league was too savage by saying, \"\\'I have never seen a maliciously dirty football player in my life and I don\\'t believe there are any.\\'\"  Nevertheless, he ordered broadcasts to follow a strict rule of conduct whereby TV announcers would not be permitted to criticize the game, and neither fights, nor injuries, could be televised by virtue in his belief that announcers were \"\\'salesman for professional football  [and]  we do not want kids believing that engaging in fights is the way to play football.\\'\" Bell was criticized for censoring TV broadcasts, a charge he dismissed as not pertinent because he believed he was not impeding the print media but only advertising a product.  After CBS and NBC gained the rights to broadcast the games in 1956,  he advised the franchises to avoid criticizing the games or the officials, and forewarned that TV would give \"\\'us our greatest opportunity to sell the  NFL  and everyone must present to the public the greatest games\\xa0... combined with the finest sportsmanship.\\'\"  This relationship with television was the beginning of the NFL\\'s rise to becoming America\\'s most popular sport.  Compromise with the NFLPA (1956–1957)In Radovich v. National Football League, the Supreme Court ruled in Radovich\\'s favor and declared the NFL was subject to antitrust laws,  and the implication was that the legality of the draft and reserve clause were dubious.  Bell pressed a case in the media that the NFL should be exempted from antitrust regulations and proffered the league was a sport and not a business.  He invited an investigation from Congress with respect to the court\\'s ruling.  The House Judiciary committee, chaired by Emanuel Celler—who believed the draft was illegal and should be abolished, convened in July 1957 to discuss the ramifications of the Radovich decision.  Red Grange and Bell testified at the committee\\'s solicitation and argued the draft was essential to the sport\\'s success.  Representatives of the NFLPA contradicted these statements and said the draft and the reserve clause were anti-labor, and it seemed as if Congress was going to accept their position.    Faced with Congressional opposition, Bell formally recognized the NFLPA and declared he would negotiate with its representatives. However, Bell was speaking only for himself and without the auspices of the owners. Rooney; Halaas and Masich: 78  At the next owners\\' meeting, Rooney admonished they either had to recognize the NFLPA or remove Bell as commissioner. Rooney; Halaas and Masich, 2007, p. 78.  In order to do this, they had to agree in a vote that required a super-majority.  Bell unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the owners to permit the NFLPA to act as a bargaining agent for the players. Staudohar, 1986, 63; cf. Oriard: 57  However, he did reach a compromise with the owners to get them to acquiesce to some of the NFLPA\\'s requests for salary standards and health benefits.  Final days (1958–1959)For the 1958 season, the durations of timeouts was extended from 60 to 90 seconds  and Bell mandated officials call a few TV timeouts during each game — a change which triggered criticism from sportswriters.  The 1958 championship game became the first NFL championship game decided in overtime  and it was considered to be the greatest football game ever played.  The game further increased football\\'s marketability to television advertising,  and the drama associated with overtime was the catalyst.  Years later, after witnessing Bell openly crying after the game, Raymond Berry attributed it to Bell\\'s realization of the impact the game would have on the prevalence of the sport. The death of Mara in February 1959 unsettled Bell and he experienced a heart attack later that month. Lyons: 308  He converted to Catholicism in the summer of 1959 because of the lifelong urging of his wife,  Mara\\'s death, and his enduring friendship with Rooney,  a practicing Catholic.  Bell was advised by his doctor to avoid going to football games, to which he quipped, \"I\\'d rather die watching football than in my bed with my boots off.\"  Bell and his children attended an Eagles game at Franklin Field in October 1959. Lyons: 275  The Eagles held complimentary box seats for him and guests to watch the game, but he preferred to buy his own tickets and sit with the other fans.  Sitting behind the end zone during the fourth quarter of the game, he suffered a heart attack and passed away later that day.  His funeral was held at Narberth\\'s St. Margaret Roman Catholic Church and Monsignor Cornelius P. Brennan delivered the eulogy, as close friends and admirers attended the mass. Lyons: 312  Dominic Olejniczak and all the extant owners of the NFL franchises were pallbearers.  Bell was interred at Cavalry Cemetery in West Conshohocken, Pennsylvania.  Legacy and honors Bell was inducted into the Professional Football Hall of Fame,  Lyons: 315  the Penn Athletics Hall of Fame,  the Philadelphia Sports Hall of Fame,  and Haverford\\'s Athletic Hall of Fame.  The Maxwell Football Club, which he founded in 1937,  has presented the best NFL player of the year with the Bert Bell Award since 1959.  The Bert Bell Benefit Bowl was exhibited in his honor from 1960 through 1969. Bell was \"a man of buoyant joviality,   with a rough and ready wit,  laughter and genuine humility and honesty, clearly innocent of pretense and  [pretension] .\"  Though his career spanned the desegregation and reintegration of the NFL, as an owner, he never had an African American on any of his teams, but Bert Jr. believed the mere discussion of whether his father was prejudiced was absurd.  Bell\\'s handling of the merger with the AAFC was acclaimed as a personal triumph.  Although he did not have the wherewithal to prevent the wholesale betting on games,  he was proactive in ensuring games were not tampered with by gamblers,  and he created the foundation of the contemporary NFL anti-gambling policy.  Bell was criticized as being too strict with his refusal to let sold-out games to be televised locally.  Nevertheless, his balancing of television broadcasts against protecting game attendance made the NFL the \"healthiest professional sport in America\",  and he was the \"leading protagonist in pro football\\'s evolution into America\\'s major sport.\"  He had understood that the league needed a cooperative television contract with revenue-sharing, but he failed to overcome the obstacles to achieve it.  He was portrayed by sportswriters as ensuring the owners treated the players fairly,  and his decision to recognize the NFLPA in the face of adversity from owners was a \"master stroke\" in thwarting Congressional intervention.  After he initiated terms for a pension plan with the players in 1959, little progress was made with the NFLPA,   however, the first players\\' pension plan-the Bert Bell National Football League Retirement Plan, was approved in 1962.  Bell\\'s implementation of the draft did not show immediate results,  but it was \"the single greatest contributor to the  [league]\\'s  prosperity\" in its first eighty-four years.  His original version of the draft was later ruled unconstitutional,  but his anchoring of the success of the league to competitive balance has been \"hailed by contemporaries and sports historians\".

It is often used in parallel computing to predict the theoretical maximum speedup using multiple processors. It was presented at the AFIPS Spring Joint Computer Conference in 1967.The speedup of a program using multiple processors in parallel computing is limited by the time needed for the sequential fraction of the program. For example, if a program needs 20 hours using a single processor core, and a particular portion of 1 hour cannot be parallelized, while the remaining promising portion of 19 hours (95%) can be parallelized, then regardless of how many processors we devote to a parallelized execution of this program, the minimum execution time cannot be less than that critical 1 hour. Hence the speedup is limited up to 20×, as the diagram illustrates. DescriptionAmdahl\\'s law is a model for the relationship between the expected speedup of parallelized implementations of an algorithm relative to the serial algorithm, under the assumption that the problem size remains the same when parallelized. For example, if for a given problem size a parallelized implementation of an algorithm can run 12% of the algorithm\\'s operations arbitrarily quickly (while the remaining 88% of the operations are not parallelizable), Amdahl\\'s law states that the maximum speedup of the parallelized version is   times as fast as the non-parallelized implementation.More technically, the law is concerned with the speedup achievable from an improvement to a computation that affects a proportion P of that computation where the improvement has a speedup of S. (For example, if 30% of the computation may be the subject of a speed up, P will be 0.3; if the improvement makes the portion affected twice as fast, S will be 2.) Amdahl\\'s law states that the overall speedup of applying the improvement will be:  \\\\frac{1}{(1 - P) + \\\\frac{P}{S}} = \\\\frac{1}{(1 - 0.3) + \\\\frac{0.3}{2}} = 1.1765  To see how this formula was derived, assume that the running time of the old computation was 1, for some unit of time. The running time of the new computation will be the length of time the unimproved fraction takes (which is 1 − P), plus the length of time the improved fraction takes. The length of time for the improved part of the computation is the length of the improved part\\'s former running time divided by the speedup, making the length of time of the improved part P/S. The final speedup is computed by dividing the old running time by the new running time, which is what the above formula does.Here\\'s another example. We are given a sequential task which is split into four consecutive parts: P1, P2, P3 and P4 with the percentages of runtime being 11%, 18%, 23% and 48% respectively.  Then we are told that P1 is not speed up, so S1 = 1, while P2 is speed up 5×, P3 is speed up 20×, and P4 is speed up 1.6×. By using the formula P1/S1 + P2/S2 + P3/S3 + P4/S4, we find the new sequential running time is:  \\\\frac{0.11}{1} + \\\\frac{0.18}{5} + \\\\frac{0.23}{20} + \\\\frac{0.48}{1.6} = 0.4575.  or a little less than   the original running time. Using the formula  , the overall speed boost is 1 / 0.4575 = 2.186, or a little more than double the original speed.  Notice how the 20× and 5× speedup don\\'t have much effect on the overall speed when P1 (11%) is not sped up, and P4 (48%) is sped up only 1.6 times. ParallelizationIn the case of parallelization, Amdahl\\'s law states that if P is the proportion of a program that can be made parallel (i.e., benefit from parallelization), and (1 − P) is the proportion that cannot be parallelized (remains serial), then the maximum speedup that can be achieved by using N processors is  S(N) = \\\\frac{1}{(1-P) + \\\\frac{P}{N}} . In the limit, as N tends to infinity, the maximum speedup tends to 1 / (1 − P). In practice, performance to price ratio falls rapidly as N is increased once there is even a small component of (1 − P).As an example, if P is 90%, then (1 − P) is 10%, and the problem can be sped up by a maximum of a factor of 10, no matter how large the value of N used. For this reason, parallel computing is only useful for either small numbers of processors, or problems with very high values of P: so-called embarrassingly parallel problems. A great part of the craft of parallel programming consists of attempting to reduce the component (1 – P) to the smallest possible value.P can be estimated by using the measured speedup (SU) on a specific number of processors (NP) using  P_\\\\text{estimated} = \\\\frac{\\\\frac{1}{SU} - 1}{\\\\frac{1}{NP} - 1} . P estimated in this way can then be used in Amdahl\\'s law to predict speedup for a different number of processors. Relation to law of diminishing returnsAmdahl\\'s law is often conflated with the law of diminishing returns, whereas only a special case of applying Amdahl\\'s law demonstrates \\'law of diminishing returns\\'. If one picks optimally (in terms of the achieved speed-up) what to improve, then one will see monotonically decreasing improvements as one improves. If, however, one picks non-optimally, after improving a sub-optimal component and moving on to improve a more optimal component, one can see an increase in return. Note that it is often rational to improve a system in an order that is \"non-optimal\" in this sense, given that some improvements are more difficult or consuming of development time than others.Amdahl\\'s law does represent the law of diminishing returns if you are considering what sort of return you get by adding more processors to a machine, if you are running a fixed-size computation that will use all available processors to their capacity. Each new processor you add to the system will add less usable power than the previous one. Each time you double the number of processors the speedup ratio will diminish, as the total throughput heads toward the limit of  \\\\scriptstyle 1 / (1 \\\\,-\\\\, P) .This analysis neglects other potential bottlenecks such as memory bandwidth and I/O bandwidth, if they do not scale with the number of processors; however, taking into account such bottlenecks would tend to further demonstrate the diminishing returns of only adding processors. Speedup in a sequential program The maximum speedup in an improved sequential program, where some part was sped up  p  times is limited by inequality  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{p}{1 + f \\\\cdot (p - 1)}  where  \\\\scriptstyle f  ( \\\\scriptstyle 0 \\\\; ) is the fraction of time (before the improvement) spent in the part that was not improved. For example (see picture on right): If part B is made five times faster ( \\\\scriptstyle p \\\\;=\\\\; 5 ),  \\\\scriptstyle t_A \\\\;=\\\\; 3 ,  \\\\scriptstyle t_B \\\\;=\\\\; 1 , and  \\\\scriptstyle f \\\\;=\\\\; t_A / (t_A \\\\,+\\\\, t_B) \\\\;=\\\\; 0.75 , then  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{5}{1 + 0.75 \\\\cdot (5 - 1)} = 1.25  If part A is made to run twice as fast ( \\\\scriptstyle p \\\\;=\\\\; 2 ),  \\\\scriptstyle t_B \\\\;=\\\\; 1 ,  \\\\scriptstyle t_A \\\\;=\\\\; 3 , and  \\\\scriptstyle f \\\\;=\\\\; t_B / (t_A \\\\,+\\\\, t_B) \\\\;=\\\\; 0.25 , then  \\\\text{maximum speedup } \\\\le \\\\frac{2}{1 + 0.25 \\\\cdot (2 - 1)} = 1.60  Therefore, making A twice as fast is better than making B five times faster. The percentage improvement in speed can be calculated as  \\\\text{percentage improvement} = \\\\left(1 - \\\\frac{1}{\\\\text{speedup factor}}\\\\right) \\\\cdot 100  Improving part A by a factor of two will increase overall program speed by a factor of 1.6, which makes it 37.5% faster than the original computation. However, improving part B by a factor of five, which presumably requires more effort, will only achieve an overall speedup factor of 1.25, which makes it 20% faster. Relation to Gustafson\\'s Law John L. Gustafson pointed out in 1988 what is now known as Gustafson\\'s Law: people typically are not interested in solving a fixed problem in the shortest possible period of time, as Amdahl\\'s Law describes, but rather in solving the largest possible problem (e.g., the most accurate possible approximation) in a fixed \"reasonable\" amount of time.  If the non-parallelizable portion of the problem is fixed, or grows very slowly with problem size (e.g., O(log n)), then additional processors can increase the possible problem size without limit.

They are named after the Biblical character Cush, who was traditionally identified as an ancestor of the speakers of these specific languages as early as AD 947 (in Masudi\\'s Arabic history Meadows of Gold).  The most populous Cushitic language is Oromo with about 35 million speakers, followed by Somali with about 18 million speakers, and Sidamo in Ethiopia with about 2 million speakers. Other languages with more than one million speakers are Hadia (1.6 million), Kambata (1.4 million), and Afar (1.5 million). CompositionThere are six clearly valid groups of languages which are usually included in the Cushitic family (Beja, Agaw, Sidamic, Lowland East Cushitic, Dullay, and South Cushitic), as well as a few poorly classified languages (Yaaku, Dahalo, Aasax and Kw\\'adza, Boon, and the Cushitic element of Mbugu). However, there is a wide range of opinions as to how they are interrelated. Richard Hayward, \"Afroasiatic\", in Heine & Nurse, 2000, African Languages The Beja language, or North Cushitic, is sometimes placed outside Cushitic proper. The positions of the Dullay languages and Yaaku are uncertain. These have traditionally been assigned to an East Cushitic branch along with Highland (Sidamic) and Lowland East Cushitic. However, Hayward believes East Cushitic may not be a valid node and that its constituents should be considered separately when attempting to work out the internal relationships of Cushitic. Hetzron (1980:70ff)  and Ehret (1995) have suggested that the Rift languages (South Cushitic) are a part of Lowland East Cushitic, the only one of the six groups with much internal diversity.Cushitic was traditionally seen as also including the Omotic languages, then called West Cushitic. However, this view has largely been abandoned, with Omotic generally agreed to be an independent branch of Afroasiatic, primarily due to the work of Harold C. Fleming (1974) and M. Lionel Bender (1975). References  Ethnologue entry for Cushitic languages Bender, Marvin Lionel. 1975. Omotic: a new Afroasiatic language family. Southern Illinois University Museum series, number 3.

Many experts, football critics, former players, current players and football fans in general consider Maradona to be the greatest football player of all time.     He was joint FIFA Player of the 20th Century with Pelé.  \"Maradona or Pele?\". CNN Sports Illustrated. Retrieved 13 March 2013 He is the only footballer to set world-record contract fees twice, firstly when transferring to Barcelona for a then world record £5m, and secondly, when transferred to Napoli for another record fee £6.9m. During his professional club career Maradona played for Argentinos Juniors, Boca Juniors, Barcelona, Napoli, Sevilla and Newell\\'s Old Boys. At club level, he is most famous for his career in Napoli where he won numerous accolades. In his international career, playing for Argentina, he earned 91 caps and scored 34 goals.He played in four FIFA World Cup tournaments, including the 1986 tournament, where he captained Argentina and led them to their victory over West Germany in the final, winning the Golden Ball award as the tournament\\'s best player. In that same tournament\\'s quarterfinal round, he scored both goals in a 2–1 victory over England that entered football history, though for two different reasons. The first goal was via an unpenalized handball known as the \"Hand of God\", while the second goal followed a   dribble past five England players, voted  \"The Goal of the Century\" by FIFA.com voters in 2002. Maradona is considered one of the sport\\'s most controversial and newsworthy figures. He was suspended from football for 15 months in 1991 after failing a drug test, for cocaine, in Italy, and he was sent home from the 1994 World Cup in the USA after testing positive for ephedrine. In 2005, he lost the weight and he overcame his cocaine addiction. His outspoken manners have sometimes put him at odds with journalists and sport executives. Although he had little managerial experience, he became head coach of the Argentina national team in November 2008, and held the job for eighteen months, until his contract expired after the 2010 World Cup. Early yearsMaradona was born on 30 October 1960, at the Policlínico (Polyclinic) Evita Hospital in Lanús, Buenos Aires Province, but raised in Villa Fiorito, a shantytown on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires,  to a poor family that had moved from Corrientes Province. He was the first son after three daughters. He has two younger brothers, Hugo (el Turco) and Raúl (Lalo), both of whom were also professional football players. Maradona has Spanish, and indigenous ancestry. He was the fifth child and first son of ‘Chitoro’ Diego Maradona and ‘Doña Tota’ Dalma Salvadora Franco (1930–2011). Both his parents were illegitimate children; his father took the family name of his mother because his father did not recognise him as his own while his mother was only recognised by her father, Maradona’s grandfather Atanancio Ramón Edisto Franco when she was eighteen years old. They were both born and brought up in the town of Esquina in the north-east province of Corrientes Province, living only two hundred yards from each other on the banks of the Corriente River. In 1950, they left Esquina and settled in Buenos Aires. Maradona is a mestizo, a term traditionally used in Spain and Latin America for people of mixed Native American and European descent. There is a dispute as to the source of the name Maradona. It had long been believed that it was of Italian origin, however Spanish researchers assert that the name originated from the region of Galicia. At age 10, Maradona was spotted by a talent scout while he was playing in his neighborhood club Estrella Roja. He became a staple of Los Cebollitas (The Little Onions), the junior team of Buenos Aires\\'s Argentinos Juniors. As a 12-year-old ball boy, he amused spectators by showing his wizardry with the ball during the halftime intermissions of first division games.  Club career Argentinos Juniors and Boca Juniors On 20 October 1976, Maradona made his professional debut with Argentinos Juniors, ten days before his sixteenth birthday. A SUMMARY OF MARADONA\\'s LIFE www.vivadiego.com. Retrieved 18 August 2006.  He played there between 1976 and 1981, scoring 115 goals in 167 appearances before his £1m transfer to Boca Juniors. Having joined the Boca squad midway through the 1981 season, Maradona played through 1982 earning his first league championship medal. Whilst playing for Argentinos Juniors, English club Sheffield United negotiated a fee of £600,000 for the 17 year old but then realised they couldn\\'t afford it.  BarcelonaAfter the 1982 World Cup, in June, Maradona was transferred to FC Barcelona in Spain for a then world record £5m ($7.6m).  In 1983, under coach César Luis Menotti, Barcelona and Maradona won the Copa del Rey (Spain\\'s annual national cup competition), beating Real Madrid, and the Spanish Super Cup, beating Athletic Bilbao. However, Maradona had a difficult tenure in Barcelona. That\\'s one hell of a diet, Diego 8 January 2006. Guardian Newspapers Limited. Retrieved 13 August 2006.  First a bout with hepatitis, then a broken ankle caused by an ill-timed tackle by Athletic\\'s Andoni Goikoetxea threatened with jeopardizing Maradona\\'s career,  but after treatment and therapy it was possible for him to soon be back on the pitch.  During his two injury-hit seasons at Barcelona, Maradona scored 38 goals in 58 games.  At Barcelona, Maradona got into frequent disputes with the team\\'s directors, especially club president Josep Lluís Núñez, culminating with a demand to be transferred out of Camp Nou in 1984. He was transferred to Napoli in Italy\\'s Serie A for another world record fee, £6.9m ($10.48m).  Napoli At Napoli, Maradona reached the peak of his professional career. He quickly became an adored star among the club\\'s fans, and in his time there he elevated the team to the most successful era in its history. Led by Maradona, Napoli won their only Serie A Italian Championships in 1986/87 and 1989/1990, placing second in the league twice, in 1987/88 and 1988/89. Other honors during the Maradona era at Napoli included the Coppa Italia in 1987, (second place in the Coppa Italia in 1989), the UEFA Cup in 1989 and the Italian Supercup in 1990. Maradona was the top scorer in Serie A in 1987/88.During his time in Italy, Maradona\\'s personal problems increased. His cocaine use continued, and he received US $70,000 in fines from his club for missing games and practices, ostensibly because of \\'stress\\'.  He faced a scandal there regarding an illegitimate son; and he was also the object of some suspicion over an alleged friendship with the Camorra.     Later on, in honor of Maradona and his achievements during his career at Napoli, the #10 jersey of Napoli was officially retired.  Sevilla, Newell\\'s Old Boys and Boca JuniorsAfter serving a 15-month ban for failing a drug test for cocaine, Maradona left Napoli in disgrace in 1992. Despite interest from Real Madrid of Spain and Olympique Marseille of France, he signed for Sevilla of Spain, where he stayed for one year.  In 1993 he played for Newell\\'s Old Boys and in 1995 he returned to Boca Juniors for two years.  Maradona also appeared for Tottenham Hotspur in a friendly match against Internazionale, shortly before the 1986 World Cup. The match was Osvaldo Ardiles\\' testimonial, who insisted his friend Maradona played, which Tottenham won 2–1. He played alongside Glenn Hoddle, who gave up his number ten shirt for the Argentine.    International career Along with his time at Napoli, international football is where Maradona found his fame. Playing for the Albicelestes of the Argentina national football team, he participated in four consecutive FIFA World Cup tournaments, leading Argentina to victory in 1986 and to second place in 1990.He made his full international debut at age 16, against Hungary on 27 February 1977. At age 18, he played the World Youth Championship for Argentina, and was the star of the tournament, shining in their 3–1 final win over the Soviet Union. On 2 June 1979, Maradona scored his first senior international goal in a 3–1 win against Scotland at Hampden Park.  He is the only player to win the Golden Ball at both the FIFA U-20 World Cup and FIFA World Cup, in 1979 and 1986. 1982 World Cup Maradona played his first World Cup tournament in 1982. Argentina played Belgium in the opening game of the 1982 Cup in Barcelona. The Catalan crowd was eager to see their new world-record signing Diego Maradona in action, but he did not perform to expectations.  Argentina, the defending champions, lost to Belgium 1–0. Although the team convincingly beat Hungary and El Salvador to progress to the second round, they were defeated in the second round by Brazil and by eventual winners Italy. The Italian match is renowned for Maradona being aggressively man-marked by Claudio Gentile, as Italy beat Argentina in Maradona\\'s new home city of Barcelona.  Maradona played in all five matches without being substituted, scoring twice against Hungary, but was sent off with 5 minutes remaining in the game against Brazil for serious foul play.  1986 World Cup Maradona captained the Argentine national team to victory in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, winning the final in Mexico against West Germany. Throughout the 1986 World Cup Maradona asserted his dominance and was the most dynamic player of the tournament. He played every minute of every Argentina game, scored 5 goals and made 5 assists, three of those in the opening match against South Korea. His first goal of the tournament came against Italy in the second group game.  After scoring two goals in the 2–1 quarter-final win against England his legend was cemented.This match was played with the background of the Falklands War between Argentina and the United Kingdom and emotions were still lingering in the air throughout the entire match. Replays showed that the first goal was scored by striking the ball with his hand. Maradona was coyly evasive, describing it as \"a little with the head of Maradona and a little with the hand of God.\" It became known as the \"Hand of God\". Ultimately, on 22 August 2005 Maradona acknowledged on his television show that he had hit the ball with his hand purposely, and no contact with his head was made, and that he immediately knew the goal was illegitimate. This became known as an international fiasco in World Cup history. The goal stood, much to the wrath of the English players.    Maradona\\'s second goal, just four minutes after the hotly disputed hand-goal, was later voted by FIFA as the greatest goal in the history of the World Cup. He received the ball in his own half, swivelled around, and with 11 touches ran more than half the length of the field, dribbling past five English outfield players (Peter Beardsley, Steve Hodge, Peter Reid, Terry Butcher, and Terry Fenwick) and goalkeeper Peter Shilton. This goal was voted \"Goal of the Century\" in a 2002 online poll conducted by FIFA.   Maradona followed this with two more goals in the semi-final against Belgium, including another virtuoso dribbling display for the second goal. In the final, the opposing West German side attempted to contain him by double-marking, but he nevertheless found the space to give the final pass to Jorge Burruchaga for the winning goal. Argentina beat West Germany 3–2 in front of 115,000 spectators at the Azteca Stadium.During the course of the tournament, Maradona attempted or created more than half of Argentina\\'s shots, embarked on 90 dribbles some three times more than any other player and was fouled 53 times winning his team twice as many free kicks as any player.  Darby, James. (10 June 2010) WorldCup Legends: Maradona. Goal.com. Retrieved on 31 March 2013.  Maradona scored or assisted 10 of Argentina\\'s 14 goals including the assist for the winning goal in the final, ensuring that he would be remembered as one of the greatest names in football history. By the end of the tournament, Maradona went on to winning the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament by unanimous vote and was widely regarded to have won the World Cup virtually single-handedly.     In a tribute to him, the Azteca Stadium authorities also built a statue of him scoring the \"goal of the century\" and placed it at the entrance of the stadium.  1990 World Cup Maradona captained Argentina again in the 1990 FIFA World Cup to yet another World Cup Final. An ankle injury affected his overall performance, and he was much less dominant than four years earlier. Argentina were almost eliminated in the first round, only qualifying in third position from their group. In the round of 16 match against Brazil, Claudio Caniggia scored the only goal after being set up by Maradona.In the quarter final, Argentina faced Yugoslavia, the match ending 0–0 after 120 minutes, and Argentina advancing on penalty kicks, despite Maradona missing one of the penalties in the shootout with a weak shot to the goalkeeper\\'s right. The semifinal against the host nation Italy was also resolved on penalties after a 1–1 draw; this time, Maradona was successful with his effort, daringly rolling the ball into the net with an almost exact replica of his missed shot in the previous round. In the final, Argentina lost 1–0 to West Germany, the only goal being a penalty by Andreas Brehme in the 85th minute after a controversial foul on Rudi Völler. 1994 World CupAt the 1994 FIFA World Cup Maradona played in only two games, scoring one goal against Greece, before being sent home after failing a drug test for ephedrine doping. In his autobiography, Maradona argued that the test result was due to his personal trainer giving him the power drink Rip Fuel. His claim was that the U.S. version, unlike the Argentine one, contained the chemical and that, having run out of his Argentine dosage, his trainer unwittingly bought the U.S. formula. FIFA expelled him from USA \\'94 and Argentina were subsequently eliminated in the second round. Maradona has also separately claimed that he had an agreement with FIFA, on which the organization reneged, to allow him to use the drug for weight loss before the competition in order to be able to play.  His failed drugs test at the 1994 World Cup signaled the end of his international career, which had lasted 17 years and yielded 34 goals from 91 games. Playing style  Maradona had a compact physique and could withstand physical pressure well. His strong legs and low center of gravity gave him an advantage in short sprints. His physical strengths were illustrated by his two goals against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup. Maradona was a strategist and a team player, as well as highly technical with the ball. He could manage himself effectively in limited spaces, and would attract defenders only to quickly dash out of the melee (as in the second 1986 goal against England),  or give an assist to a free teammate. Being short, but strong, he could hold the ball long enough with a defender on his back to wait for a teammate making a run or to find a gap for a quick shot.One of Maradona\\'s trademark moves was dribbling full-speed on the right wing, and on reaching the opponent\\'s goal line, delivering accurate passes to his teammates. Another trademark was the Rabona, a reverse-cross pass shot behind the leg that holds all the weight. This maneuver led to several assists, such as the powerful cross for Ramón Díaz\\'s header in the 1980 friendly against Switzerland. He was also a dangerous free kick taker.Maradona was dominantly left-footed, often using his left foot even when the ball was positioned more suitably for a right-footed connection. His first goal against Belgium in the 1986 World Cup semi-final is a worthy indicator of such; he had run into the inside right channel to receive a pass but let the ball travel across to his left foot, requiring more technical ability. During his run past several England players in the previous round for the \"Goal of the Century\", he did not use his right foot once, despite spending the whole movement on the right-hand side of the pitch. In the 1990 World Cup second round tie against Brazil, he did use his right foot to set up the winning goal for Caniggia due to two Brazilian markers forcing him into a position that made use of his left foot less practical. Retirement and honours Hounded for years by the press, Maradona once fired a compressed-air rifle at reporters who he claimed were invading his privacy. This quote from former teammate Jorge Valdano summarizes the feelings of many:  In 2000, Maradona published his autobiography Yo Soy El Diego (\"I am The Diego\"), which became an instant bestseller  in his home country. Two years later, Maradona donated the Cuban royalties of his book to \"the Cuban people and Fidel.\" In 1999, he won FIFA Player of the Century award which was to be decided by votes on their official website, their official magazine and a grand jury. Maradona won the Internet based poll by wide margins, garnering 53.6% of the votes against 18.53% for Pelé. In spite of this, and shortly before the ceremony, FIFA unexpectedly decided to add a second award and appointed a \"Football Family\" committee composed of football journalists that also gave to Pelé the title of best player of the century to make it a draw.  Maradona also came fifth in the vote of IFFHS(International Federation of Football History and Statistics).  In 1999 Konex Foundation from Argentina granted him the Diamond Konex Award, one of the most prestigious culture awards in Argentina, as the most important personality in Sports in the last decade in his country.In 2001, the Argentine Football Association (AFA) asked FIFA for authorization to retire the jersey number 10 for Maradona. FIFA did not grant the request, even though Argentine officials have maintained that FIFA hinted that it would.  Maradona has topped a number of fan polls, including a 2002 FIFA poll in which his second goal against England was chosen as the best goal ever scored in a World Cup; he also won the most votes in a poll to determine the All-Time Ultimate World Cup Team. On 22 March 2010, Maradona was chosen number 1 in The Greatest 10 World Cup players of all time by the London based newspaper The Times.  Argentinos Juniors named its stadium after Maradona on 26 December 2003.In 2003, Maradona was employed by the Libyan footballer Al-Saadi Gaddafi, the third son of Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, as a \"technical consultant\", while Al-Saadi was playing for the Italian club, Perugia Calcio, which was in Serie A at the time. On 22 June 2005, it was announced that Maradona would return to Boca Juniors as a sports vice president in charge of managing the First Division roster (after a disappointing 2004–05 season, which coincided with Boca\\'s centenary).  His contract began 1 August 2005, and one of his first recommendations proved to be very effective: he was the one who decided to hire Alfio Basile as the new coach. With Maradona fostering a close relationship with the players, Boca went on to win the 2005 Apertura title, the 2006 Clausura title, the 2005 Copa Sudamericana and the 2005 Recopa Sudamericana. On 15 August 2005, Maradona made his debut as host of a talk-variety show on Argentine television, La Noche del 10 (\"The Night of the no. 10\"). His main guest on opening night was Pelé; the two had a friendly chat, showing no signs of past differences. However, the show also included a cartoon villain with a clear physical resemblance to Pelé. In subsequent evenings, he led the ratings on all occasions but one. Most guests were drawn from the worlds of football and show business, including Zidane, Ronaldo and Hernán Crespo, but also included interviews with other notable personalities such as Fidel Castro and Mike Tyson.On 26 August 2006, it was announced that Maradona was quitting his position in the club Boca Juniors because of disagreements with the AFA, who selected Basile to be the new coach of the Argentina national football team. The award-winning Serbian filmmaker Emir Kusturica made a documentary about Maradona\\'s life, entitled Maradona.In May 2006, Maradona agreed to take part in UK\\'s Soccer Aid (a program to raise money for Unicef).  In September 2006, Maradona, in his famous blue and white number 10, was the captain for Argentina in a three-day World Cup of Indoor Football tournament in Spain. Also in 2006, it was claimed by IIMSAM that Diego Maradona was appointed as a Goodwill Ambassador of IIMSAM the Intergovernmental Institution for the use of Micro-algae Spirulina Against Malnutrition.  Managerial career Club managementHe attempted to work as a coach alongside former Argentinos Juniors midfield team mate Carlos Fren. The pair led Mandiyú of Corrientes (1994) and Racing Club (1995), but with little success.  In May 2011 he became manager of Dubai club Al Wasl FC in the United Arab Emirates. Maradona was sacked in 10 July 2012.    International managementAfter the resignation of Argentina national football team coach Alfio Basile in 2008, Diego Maradona immediately proposed his candidacy for the vacant role. According to several press sources, his major challengers included Diego Simeone, Carlos Bianchi, Miguel Ángel Russo and Sergio Batista.On 29 October 2008, AFA chairman Julio Grondona confirmed that Maradona would be the head coach of the national side from December 2008. On 19 November 2008, Diego Maradona managed Argentina for the first time when Argentina played against Scotland at Hampden Park in Glasgow which Argentina won 1–0. After winning his first three matches in charge of the national team, he oversaw a 6–1 defeat to Bolivia, equalling the team\\'s worst ever margin of defeat. With two matches remaining in the qualification tournament for the 2010 World Cup, Argentina was in fifth place and faced the possibility of failing to qualify, but victory in the last two matches secured qualification for the finals.  After Argentina\\'s qualification, Maradona used abusive language at the live post-game press conference, telling members of the media to \"suck it and keep on sucking it\".  FIFA responded with a two-month ban on all footballing activity, which expired on 15 January 2010, and a CHF 25,000 fine, with a warning as to his future conduct.   The friendly match scheduled to take place at home to the   on 15 December, during the period of the ban, was cancelled. The only match Argentina played during Maradona\\'s ban was a friendly away to  , which Argentina lost 4–2.At the World Cup finals in June 2010, Argentina started by winning 1–0 against Nigeria, and then defeated South Korea by 4–1, with a hat-trick from Gonzalo Higuain.   In the final match of the group stage Argentina won 2–0 against Greece to win their the group and advance to a second round meeting with Mexico.  After defeating Mexico 3–1, Argentina was in turn routed by Germany, 4–0 in the quarter finals to go out of the competition.  Argentina was ranked 5th in the tournament. After the defeat to Germany Maradona admitted that he was considering his future as Argentina coach, \"I may leave tomorrow,\" he said.  On 15 July 2010, the Argentine Football Association said that he would be offered a new 4 year deal that would keep him in charge through to the summer of 2014 when Brazil stages the World Cup,  however on 27 July the AFA announced that its board had unanimously decided not to renew his contract.  Afterwards on 29 July 2010, Maradona claimed that AFA president Julio Grondona and director of national teams Carlos Bilardo had \"lied to\" and \"betrayed\" and effectively sacked him from the role. Saying \"they wanted me to continue, but seven of my staff should not go on, if he told me that, it meant he did not want me to keep working\".  Personal life FamilyHis parents are Diego Maradona Snr and Dalma Salvadore Franco. His father is of Native American origin.   Maradona married long-time fiancée Claudia Villafañe on 7 November 1984 in Buenos Aires, and they had two daughters, Dalma Nerea (born on 2 April 1987) and Giannina Dinorah (born on 16 May 1989), by whom he became a grandfather in 2009.  In his autobiography, Maradona admits he was not always faithful to Claudia, even though he refers to her as the love of his life.Maradona and Villafañe divorced in 2004. Daughter Dalma has since asserted that the divorce was the best solution for all, as her parents remained on friendly terms. They travelled together to Napoli for a series of homages in June 2005  and were seen together on many other occasions, including the Argentina matches during 2006 FIFA World Cup.During the divorce proceedings, Maradona admitted he was the father of Diego Sinagra (born in Naples on 20 September 1986). The Italian courts had already so ruled in 1993, after Maradona refused to undergo DNA tests for proving or disproving his paternity. Diego Jr. met Maradona for the first time in May 2003 after tricking his way onto a golf course in Italy where Maradona was playing.   Diego Sinagra is now a footballer playing in Italy.   After the divorce, Claudia embarked on a career as a theatre producer, and Dalma was seeking an acting career; she had expressed her desire to attend the Actor\\'s Studio in Los Angeles.  His younger daughter, Giannina, is currently married to Manchester City striker Sergio Agüero, with whom she has a son, Benjamin, born in Madrid on 19 February 2009.His Mother, Dalma, died on 19 November 2011. Diego was in Dubai at the time, and desperately tried to fly back in time to see her, but was too late. She was 81 years old.His son Diego Fernando whom he had with his ex long term partner Veronica Ojeda was born 13 February of 2013. Drug abuse and health issues From the mid-1980s until 2004 Diego Maradona was addicted to cocaine. He allegedly began using the drug in Barcelona in 1983.   By the time he was playing for Napoli he had a regular addiction, which began to interfere with his ability to play football. Over the years following his retirement his health seriously deteriorated. On 4 January 2000, while vacationing in Punta del Este, Uruguay, Maradona had to be rushed to the emergency room of a local clinic. In a press conference, doctors stated that it was detected heart muscle damage due to \"an underlying health issue\". It was later known that traces of cocaine were found in his blood and Maradona had to explain the circumstances to the police. After this he left Argentina and went to Cuba in order to follow a drug rehab plan.On 18 April 2004, doctors reported that Maradona had suffered a major myocardial infarction following a cocaine overdose; he was admitted to intensive care in a Buenos Aires hospital. Scores of fans gathered around the clinic. He was taken off the respirator on 23 April and remained in intensive care for several days before being discharged on 29 April. He tried to return to Cuba, where he had spent most of his time in the years leading up to the heart attack, but his family opposed, having filed a judicial petition to exercise his legal guardianship.Maradona had a tendency to put on weight, and suffered increasingly from obesity from the end of his playing career until undergoing gastric bypass surgery in a clinic in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia on 6 March 2005.    His surgeon said that Maradona would follow a liquid diet for three months in order to return back his normal weight.  When Maradona resumed public appearances shortly thereafter, he displayed a notably thinner figure.   On 29 March 2007, Maradona was readmitted to a hospital in Buenos Aires. He was treated for hepatitis and effects of alcohol abuse, and was released on 11 April, but re-admitted two days later.  In the following days there were constant rumors about his health, including three false claims of his death within a month.  After transfer to a psychiatric clinic specialising in alcohol-related problems, he was discharged on 7 May. On 8 May 2007, Maradona appeared on Argentine television and stated that he had quit drinking and had not used drugs in two and a half years.  Political views Only in recent years, Maradona has shown sympathy to left-wing ideologies. Before that he had been vocal in his support of neoliberal Argentina President Carlos Menem, and especially of his Harvard University-educated economist Domingo Cavallo. He became friends with Cuban leader Fidel Castro while receiving treatment on the island. He also has a portrait of Fidel Castro tattooed on his left leg and one of Fidel\\'s second in command, fellow Argentine Che Guevara on his right arm.  In his autobiography, El Diego, he dedicated the book to several people and groups of people including Fidel Castro, he wrote \"To Fidel Castro and, through him, all the Cuban people\". Maradona was also a supporter of former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. In 2005 he visited Venezuela with the specific aim of meeting Chávez, who received him in Miraflores. After this meeting Maradona claimed that he had come with the aim of meeting a \"great man\" (\"un grande\" in Spanish) but he had met instead a gigantic man (\"un gigante\" in Spanish, meaning he was more than great).\"I believe in Chávez, I am Chavista. Everything Fidel does, everything Chávez does, for me is the best.\" He has declared his opposition to what he identifies as imperialism, notably during the 2005 Summit of the Americas in Mar del Plata, Argentina. There he protested George W. Bush\\'s presence in Argentina, wearing a T-shirt labeled \" STOP BUSH \" (with the \"s\" in \"Bush\" being replaced with a swastika) and referring to Bush as \"human garbage\".  In August 2007, Maradona went further, making an appearance on Chávez\\'s weekly television show and saying: \"I hate everything that comes from the United States. I hate it with all my strength.\"  In December 2007, Maradona presented a signed shirt with a message of support to the people of Iran: it is to be displayed in the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs\\' museum.    Financial problemsIn March 2009 Italian officials announced that Maradona still owed the Italian government €37\\xa0million in taxes; €23.5\\xa0million of which was accrued interest on his original debt. They reported that thus far, Maradona has paid only €42,000, two luxury watches and a set of earrings.   In popular cultureThe American newspaper The Houston Chronicle wrote about Maradona:  In Argentina, Maradona is considered a sports hero to many. He is idolized, receiving the name of “God”. About this idolatry that exists in Argentina over Maradona, his former teammate Jorge Valdano said: \"At the time that Maradona retired from active football, left traumatized Argentina. Maradona was more than just a great footballer. It was a special compensation factor for a country that in a few years lived several military dictatorships and social frustrations of all kinds\". Valdano added that \"Maradona offered to the Argentines way out of their collective frustration, and that\\'s why people love him. There is a divine figure.\"Ever since 1986, it is common for Argentines abroad to hear Maradona\\'s name as a token of recognition, even in remote places.  The Tartan Army sing a version of the Hokey Cokey in honour of the Hand of God goal against England.  In Argentina, Maradona is often talked about in terms reserved for legends. In the Argentine film El Hijo de la Novia (\"Son of the Bride\"), somebody who impersonates a Catholic priest says to a bar patron: \"they idolized him and then crucified him\". When a friend scolds him for taking the prank too far, the fake priest retorts: \"But I was talking about Maradona\". He\\'s the subject of the film El Camino de San Diego, though he himself only appears in archive footage.Maradona was included in many cameos in the Argentine comic book El Cazador de Aventuras. After the closing of it, the authors started a new short-lived comic book titled \"El Die\",  using Maradona as the main character.In Rosario, Argentina, locals organized the parody religion of the \"Church of Maradona\". The organization reformulates many elements from Christian tradition, such as Christmas or prayers, reflecting instead details from Maradona. It had 200 founding members, tens of thousands more  Maradona in intensive care 28 April 2004. BBC Sport. Retrieved 18 August 2006.  have become members via the church\\'s official web site.Many Argentine artists performed songs in tribute to Diego, like: \"Maradó\" by El Potro Rodrigo, \"Maradona\" by Andrés Calamaro, \"Para siempre Diego\" (Diego forever) by Los Ratones Paranoicos, \"Para verte gambetear\" (For seeing you dribble) by La Guardia Hereje, \"Francotirador\" (Sniper) by Attaque 77, \"Dale Diez\" (C\\'mon Diez) by Julio Lacarra, \"Maradona blues\" by Charly García, \"Santa Maradona\" (Saint Maradona) by Mano Negra, \"La Vida Tombola\" by Manu Chao, \"Pelusa\"(Fluff) by Los Cafres, among others. And many films, like: Maradona, La Mano de Dios (Maradona, the Hand of God), El Camino de San Diego (Saint Diego\\'s Road), Amando a Maradona (Loving Maradona), Maradona by Kusturica, etc. A television commercial  for Brazilian soft drink Guaraná Antarctica portrayed Maradona as a member of the Brazilian national football team, including wearing the yellow jersey and singing the Brazilian national anthem with Brazilian caps Kaká and Ronaldo. Later on in the commercial he wakes up realizing it was a nightmare after having drunk too much of the Brazilian soft drink. This generated some controversy in the Argentine media after its release (although the commercial was not supposed to air on the Argentine market, fans could see it via internet). Maradona replied that he has no problem in wearing the Brazilian national squad jersey despite Argentina and Brazil having a tense rivalry in football, but that he would refuse to wear the shirt of River Plate, Boca Juniors\\' traditional rival.

Diab is the best-selling Arab recording artist of all time, according to Amr Diab Official website. He was awarded the World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist three times: 1998 for album \"Nour El Ain\", 2002 for album \"Aktrr Wahed Byhbak 2001\" and 2007 for album \"El Lillady\". Amr Diab also won The African Music Awards 2009, Big Apple Music Awards; Life Achievements Awards: Best Singer of The Year in 2009, and Best Male Act in African Music Awards 2010. Amr Diab is one of the top singers in the Arab world and considered a living legend by many of his fans in the Arab world. He is known as the Father of Mediterranean Music.    He has created his own style which is often termed \"Mediterranean Music\" or \"Mediterranean Sound\", a blend of Western and Egyptian rhythms.   In The Mediterranean in Music, David Cooper and Kevin Dawe referred to his music as \"the new breed of Mediterranean music\".  According to author Michael Frishkopf, Amr Diab has produced a new concept of Mediterranean music, especially in his international hit, \"Nour El Ain\". In his analysis of The Very Best of Amr Diab album, Victor W. Valdivia of Allmusic said: \"His music melded traditional Arabic sounds and textures with Western rhythms and instruments. The mesh was dubbed Mediterranean music, and The Very Best of Amr Diab displays Diab\\'s superb skill in creating it.\" Amr Diab is considered the biggest Egyptian pop star ever and according to the BBC, Diab \"has ruled the Arab music world, especially Egypt and the Middle East, since the mid \\'80s, continually breaking sales records\".  Musical career In 1983, Diab released his first studio album, Ya Tareeq. Diab released three more albums between 1984 and 1987. 1988\\'s \"Mayaal\" garnered huge success all around the Middle East. It was produced, arranged and remixed by German musicians, Frank Von Dem Bottlenberg, Ziyad Abou Chair and Jörg Evers, with several releases. More success followed in the following years including the albums Shawakkna, Matkhafesh, and We Yloumouni.Amr Diab quickly developed fame for his new style of \"Pan-Mediterranean\" Arabic music, fusing touches of flamenco and raï with western pop with traditional Arabic rhythms. B1992, he became the first Arabic artist to start making high-tech music videos. \"Habibi\" from Diab\\'s 1996 album Nour El Ain became a hit worldwide and was remixed by many of the world\\'s top DJs at the time.  A special CD named Habibi: The Remix Album was released later with all of these remixes. Since then, Diab has remained at the top of the Arabic music scene, expanding reach to all parts of the Mediterranean with his 1999 release, Amarain, that featured duets with Algeria\\'s king of rai Khaled in a song called \"Qalbi\" and Greece\\'s Angela Dimitriou in \"Ana Bahibak Aktar\" and \"Eleos\". \"Tamally Maak\" from Diab\\'s 2000 album became a huge success. Leily Nahari, Diab\\'s first album with Rotana Records, was released in 2004. His album El Leila De was released in the summer of 2007 and topped the Arabic music charts for 22 weeks. Diab received a World Music Award for Best Selling Middle Eastern Artist for the album. In 2008, Diab renewed his contract with Rotana for five more years.  In 2009, Diab released a new album Wayah. Influences and contributions Diab revolutionized Egyptian show business in several respects,  and some of his biographers have referred to him as rebellious, because he challenged everything in Middle Eastern show business, from hairstyle and appearance to music style, presentation, and the financial scale of his projects.Diab’s blending of Western rhythms with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern music styles created a new music style, referred to as Mediterranean music. His song “Tamalli Ma’ak”/“Always With You,” where he introduced classical guitar, is a good example of the genre. The world\\'s perspective Diab is one of the most popular and acclaimed Arab pop singers of the modern age.  In 1997 he won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival: one for Best Video, for Best Song, and for Best Artist of the Year. The following year Diab received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of Nour El Ain and received a World Music Award in Monaco. Albums Nour El Ain In 1996, Nour El Ain (Light of The Eye – Sight) was released, becoming a tremendous success not only in the Middle East but throughout the entire world. The song was composed by Nasser el-Mizdawi, lyrics were written by Ahmed Sheta and it was arranged by Hameed Elshaery. The title track, and its English version \"Habibi\", was an international phenomenon, becoming a massive crossover hit in countries such as Pakistan, India (performed by Nachiketa in Bengali keeping the tune and composition and replacing the lyrics with his own), Afghanistan, Sri Lanka (performed by Sangeeth Wickremasinghe) and Malaysia (Malay version sung by Datuk Sharifah Aini). The song was remade with Malayalam lyrics the movie Chandralekha. In a style reminiscent of the Aldo (musician) Franco-Arabic style, the song was remixed by several top European arrangers and has become a big pull on the dance floors of Europe. The video clip, also produced by Alam El Phan for the song \"Nour El Ain\", was one of the most lavish and expensive productions in the field of Egyptian song and set a new standard for his contemporaries to aspire to. This album sold 3 million copies.In 1997, Amr Diab won three awards at the Annual Arabic Festival (for Best Video, Best Song and Artist of the Year). In the following year, he received a Triple Platinum Award for the sales of Nour El Ain and received a World Music Award in Monaco on 6 May 1998, under the patronage of H.S.H. Albert II, Prince of Monaco. This award was the first of its kind for an Egyptian artist, emphasizing that his appeal is not confined to the Middle East, unlike the majority of his contemporaries. Awedoni His follow-up studio album titled Awedoni (They made me used to...) was released in July 1998 and, as with Nour El Ain, it was produced with Hamid El Shaery and recorded in Cairo, Egypt. The first video from the album, the title track \"Awedooni\", was shot by the Nile in Egypt and directed by Tareq Al Aryan. Like its predecessor, this album was a huge success for Amr and reinforced his popularity in the Arab world and abroad. Amarain Diab released his July 1999 new studio album Amarain (two moons), which is hailed as the best work of his career.  Amr is working on eagerly anticipated duets with the France-based international Rai superstar, Khaled of \"Didi\" fame, and with the Greek singer, Angela Dimitrou, whose crossover smash \"Marguerites\" was a huge hit across the Middle East in 1998. The title track \"Amarain\" was the first video to be broadcast. Tamally Ma\\'ak In July 2000, Diab revolutionized Arab music when he issued Tamally Ma\\'ak (I\\'m Always With You). The song was composed by Sherif Tag, a modern Egyptian composer. He introduced the Spanish guitar in \"Tamally Ma\\'ak\" and in other songs. The clip of this song was made in the Czech Republic with much success. The album contained songs like \"El Allem Alla\" (Only God Knows), \"Ba\\'terf\" (I Confess) which were composed by Amr Mostafa, the best Middle Eastern composer, \"Sa\\'ban Alaea\" (It Makes Me Feel Sorry) and \"We Heya Amla Eih\" (And How Is She?). The song \"Tamally Ma\\'ak\" was copied in the hit Bollywood song \"Kaho Na Kaho\" from the film Murder and also \"I\\'m Calling U\" by the group Outlandish. Aktar Wahed Aktar Wahed was released on 1 August 2001. The album\\'s name Aktar Wahed is short for one of the songs, \"Aktar Wahed Beyhebbak\" (One loves you the most). It contains 10 tracks and received the World Music Award for the best-selling album in the Middle East for 2001. Allem Albi In February 2003, Diab released Allem Alby (Teach My Heart). The album\\'s release date was arranged to be with the debut broadcast of Alam El Phan\\'s (Allem Albys production company, owned by Mohsen Gaber) music channel Mazzika.The album was a great success, with the release of the video \"Ana Ayesh\" (I\\'m Alive) which was directed by Stuart Gosling. The video was intensely broadcast on Mazzika. The album contains other songs, like the R&B-influenced hit, \"Allem Albi\". Others that tend to be more distinctively Arabic-sounding are songs like \"Kolohom\" (All of Them), \"Law Ash\\'any\" (If You Adore Me), and \"Alli El Wadaa\\'\" (Goodbye To Me). Leily Nahary In late summer 2004, Diab\\'s first album with Rotana was released: Leily Nahary (My Nights, My Days). The album\\'s cover was from the promotional photo shoot of Pepsi. The video \"Leily Nahari\" directed by Cameron Casey provided aid to give Diab his space in the record-exclusive music channels. It was criticized because of its similarity to his previously unreleased video for \"El Alem Allah\" from the album Tamally Ma\\'ak. Kammel Kalamak Diab\\'s album Kammel Kalamak, released on 14 December 2005, was the follow-up to Leily Nahary. The love ballad \"We Malo\" was released as the single of the album, Kammel Kalamak. The music video was shot in London and was released on a late notice after the release of the album. Rumors surfaced in late 2005 and early 2006 stated that Amr is considering terminating his contract with Rotana due to the poor promotion of Kammel Kalamak. El Lilady The album El Lilady (or El Leila De) was originally set to be released after Ramadan 2006. However, it was pushed back several times due to Diab\\'s repeated changes in the musical producers he was dealing with. Diab attributes the changes to the producer\\'s lack of new and strong styles. In early 2006, music arranger Fahd was supposed to work on this album; however, later that year Tarek Madkour joined Amr Diab, and they started together to work on it. On 25 March 2007, Madkour\\'s official website announced that Amr Diab and Madkour had decided jointly to skip the collaboration on the album due to the lack of time and conflicting working schedules. Fahd and new producer Hasan Al Shafei are elected to produce the music in the album, which was supposed to hit the markets in July 2007. The title of the album was changed from Khaleek Ma\\'aya to El Leila De. After the release Amr, shot a new Pepsi advertisement in Europe. On 21 June 2007, two of the biggest sites (AmrDiabWorld.com and AmrDiab.info) for Amr Diab announced that El Lilady would hit the market on 7 July 2007. The album would contain 10 tracks; Al Shafei and Fahd shared the production: Al Shaei with seven songs and Fahd with three. Before releasing his album, Diab traveled to Portugal to shoot the new Pepsi ad, choosing \"Inta El Ghaly\" song from El Leila De as the ad. Amr then traveled to the USA to film the music video for his upcoming album.The album master copy was given to Rotana, Amr Diab\\'s CD production company, on the last week of June to meet the 7 July 2007 release date he had planned. Rotana, however, delayed the release of the new CD for a couple of days for unknown reasons. The album had been leaked. The album was officially released on 11 July 2007. The album has already become a huge hit in Egypt and all over the Middle East. The video clip has been slated for a 27 July release. The song that Diab chose to film was \"N\\'eoul Eih\", which is in the new style of House Music mixed with oriental Arabic music. The video clip was filmed in Santa Monica and Malibu, and also near Hollywood. On 30 October 2007, the management of the World Music Awards announced that Amr Diab was to receive an award for best selling artist in the Middle East for this album. Amr Diab received the award in the festival that was held in Monaco, Monte Carlo, on 4 November 2007. Wayah (2009) The world music award of for the best-selling album in the Middle East 2009, Wayah (With Her) was released for sale on the internet on 27 June; however, the album was leaked online and was downloaded illegally amid complaints of slow download speed on the official site. Diab\\'s fans initiated a massive boycott of the sites with the illegal copies. On 18 October 2009 Amr Diab won four 2009 African Music Awards in the following categories: best artist, best album, best vocalist and best song for \"Wayah\"; Amr Diab has been nominated by the Big Apple Music Awards.  Aslaha Betefre (2010) Amr Diab released a mini-album for the first time in his career history, produced by Rotana, in July 2010. The mini album contains one song with the arrangements (original song, club mix, and karaoke). Banadeek Ta\\'ala (2011) In May 2011, it was announced that Amr Diab\\'s new album (at the time titled Heya Hayati) was slated for an Eid Al Fitr release. Due to the unstable political situation in Egypt, the album was pushed back and delayed until further notice. In late August 2011, Amr Diab\\'s official website announced the new album\\'s final title, Banadeek Ta\\'ala, and Rotana slated the album for a 28 September release. The album contains 12 songs that include \"Banadeek Ta\\'ala,\" \"Heya Hayaty,\" \"Aloomak Leh,\" \"Aref Habibi,\" \"Maly Enaya,\" \"Yaret Sennek,\" and \"Tagreba o Addet.\" The album was arranged by Adel Hakki and was produced by Rotana. Music videos Diab is one of the first singers to popularise music videos in the Arab world and the first Egyptian singer to appear in music videos.  With the exception of his very early releases, his albums have had at least one song shot as a music video. Diab has collaborated with a variety of music video directors in the Middle East, including Tarek El-Erian and Sherif Sabri. The most anticipated video clip of 2007, \"N\\'eoul Eih\", was released on 14 August that year on Rotana TV. It was broadcast minutes later on Egyptian television on El Beit Betak. The video was a great success.6 August 2009 witnessed the release of Amr Diab\\'s latest video clip for his smash hit \"Wayah\". Working alongside Cameron Casey and [Leily Nahari] for a second time, Amr Diab presented a fresh video clip which was filmed mostly on Green Screen and in Diab\\'s personal villa in Cairo, Egypt. The biggest surprise was the appearance of Diab\\'s children alongside his niece, who represented the younger generation of children who are inspired by the music of Amr Diab. Diab also filmed \"Ba2dem Alby\" which was released on Valentine\\'s Day. El Helm/The Dream The Dream or El Helm is a biographical TV production produced by Amr Afefy that gives viewers the story of Amr Diab\\'s life. The show consists of 12 episodes and began airing on 24 December 2008. El Helm is narrated by actor Ezzat Abou Ouf and includes interviews with Diab and people he worked with throughout the span of his career. The show, which aired on Rotana TV, saw great success and was preceded by one of the biggest advertising campaigns in the history of Middle Eastern music. Film career Diab\\'s fame in the music industry has led him to experiment with other forms of media, such as film. Amr played himself in his first film, El Afareet, which was released in 1989. It also starred Madiha Kamel. His second film Ice Cream in Gleam (Ays Krim fi Glym), in which Diab starred in 1992, was chosen as one of the best five Egyptian musical films by the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television. The film was featured in the UCLA Film and Television Archive\\'s new program \"Music on the Nile: Fifty Years of Egyptian Musical Films\" at James Bridges Theater, UCLA,  6, 8 and 10 April. David Chute of the Los Angeles Weekly termed it \"observant\" and \"a big leap\".  His third movie was released in 1993, and was named Deahk We La\\'ab (Laughter and Fun). The film premiered in the Egyptian Film Festival in 1993. Amr played alongside international Egyptian movie star Omar Sharif (Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago) and Yousra. Overall, Diab did not experience the same level of success in film that he had with his music career. Since 1993, Diab has focused on his singing career. Egyptian Revolution A few days after former President Hosni Mubarak stepped down, Amr Diab composed and sang a memorial song, \"Masr A\\'let\" (Egypt Said Its Word),  and released it in conjunction with a music video showing pictures of the martyrs who died in the uprising. He also initiated a charity campaign \"Masry Begad\" (\"Real Egyptian\"), a social national program aimed at serving and rebuilding Egyptian society. His online radio station Diab FM often presents talks and discussions about what Diab FM team can offer to the community as well as applying it practically by being present in different sites across Egypt with a new humanitarian project each week.  Endorsements Amr Diab has taken part in an internationally known Pepsi commercial featuring four other pop musicians: Beyoncé Knowles, Pink, Jennifer Lopez, and Britney Spears. In the US version, Enrique Iglesias takes the role of Caesar. But in the pan Arab version, the three American singers were retained but the male figure was replaced with Diab. This was not the first Pepsi commercial Diab has done; he also filmed commercials featuring his songs \"Ana Aktar Wahed\" (I\\'m the most), \"Allem Alby\" (teach my heart) and \"Khad Alby Ma\\'aa\" (She took my heart with her). Diab also appeared in a commercial alongside Jennifer Lopez, singing The Troggs hit \"Wild Thing\". In 2009 Pepsi decided not to renew his contract. In 2010 he was the star of \"Hayat\" bottled water campaign. Local record labels Diab\\'s earliest albums were released by Delta Sound. In 1996 Diab moved to Alam Al Phan where he released his greatest hits. In between 2003 and 2004, and after a long successful career with Alam El Phan, Diab officially announced the termination of his contract with Mohsen Gaber (owner of Alam El Phan) and move to the company that owned by Prince El Waleed Ebn Talal, Rotana Records and the owner of part of media huge muscel [Fox].

It comprises fairy shrimp, clam shrimp, Cladocera, Notostraca and the Devonian Lepidocaris. They are mostly small, freshwater animals that feed on plankton and detritus, with the exception of the Cladocera, many of which are marine. DescriptionMembers of the Branchiopoda are unified by the presence of gills on many of the animals\\' appendages, including some of the mouthparts. This is also responsible for the name of the group  (from the  , gills, akin to  , windpipe;  , foot).  They generally possess compound eyes and a carapace, which may be a shell of two valves enclosing the trunk (as in most Cladocera), broad and shallow (as in the Notostraca), or entirely absent (as in the Anostraca).    In the groups where the carapace prevents the use of the trunk limbs for swimming (Cladocera, clam shrimp and the extinct Lipostraca), the antennae are used for locomotion, as they are in the nauplius.  Male fairy shrimp have an enlarged pair of antennae with which they grasp the female during mating, while the bottom-feeding Notostraca, the antennae are reduced to vestiges.  The trunk limbs are beaten in a metachronal rhythm, causing a flow of water along the midline of the animal, from which it derives oxygen, food and, in the case of the Anostraca and Notostraca, movement.  EcologyAmong the branchiopods, only some cladocerans are marine; all the other groups are found in continental waters fresh water, including temporary pools and salt lakes.  Most branchiopodans eat floating detritus or plankton, which they take using the setae on their appendages.  TaxonomyIn early taxonomic treatments, the current members of the Branchiopoda were all placed in a single genus, Monoculus. The taxon Branchiopoda was erected by Pierre André Latreille in 1817, initially at the rank of order.  Anostraca   The fairy shrimp of the order Anostraca are usually   long (exceptionally up to  ).  Most species have 20 body segments, bearing 11 pairs of leaf-like phyllopodia (swimming legs), and the body lacks a carapace.    They live in vernal pools and hypersaline lakes across the world, including pools in deserts, in ice-covered mountain lakes and in Antarctica. They swim \"upside-down\" and feed by filtering organic particles from the water or by scraping algae from surfaces.  They are an important food for many birds and fish, and are cultured and harvested for use as fish food.    There are 300 species spread across 8 families.    Lipostraca  Lipostraca contains a single species, Lepidocaris rhyniensis,  which is the most abundant animal in the Rhynie chert desposits.  It resembles modern Anostraca, to which it is probably closely related, although its relationships to other orders remain unclear.  The body is   long, with 23 body segments and 19 pairs of appendages, but no carapace.  It occurred chiefly among charophytes, probably in alkaline temporary pools.    Notostraca  The order Notostraca comprises the single family Triopsidae, containing the tadpole shrimp or shield shrimp.    The two genera, Triops and Lepidurus, are considered living fossils, having not changed significantly in outward form since the Triassic.  They have a broad, flat carapace, which conceals the head and bears a single pair of compound eyes.  The abdomen is long, appears to be segmented and bears numerous pairs of flattened legs.  The telson is flanked by a pair of long, thin caudal rami.  Phenotypic plasticity within taxa makes species-level identification difficult, and is further compounded by variation in the mode of reproduction.  Notostracans are the largest branchiopodans and are omnivores living on the bottom of temporary pools and shallow lakes.  Laevicaudata, Spinicaudata and Cyclestherida  Clam shrimp are bivalved animals which have lived since at least the Devonian. The three groups are not believed to form a clade. They have 10–32 trunk segments, decreasing in size from front to back, and each bears a pair of legs which also carry gills. A strong muscle can close the two halves of the shell together. Cladocera   Cladocera is an order of small crustaceans commonly called water fleas. Around 620 species have been recognised so far, with many more undescribed.      They are ubiquitous in inland aquatic habitats, but rare in the oceans.    Most are   long, with a down-turned head, and a carapace covering the apparently unsegmented thorax and abdomen.    There is a single median compound eye.  Most species show cyclical parthenogenesis, where asexual reproduction is occasionally supplemented by sexual reproduction, which produces resting eggs that allow the species to survive harsh conditions and disperse to distant habitats.    EvolutionThe fossil record of branchiopods extends back at least into the Upper Cambrian and possibly further. The group is thought to be monophyletic, with the Anostraca having been the first group to branch off.    It is thought that the group evolved in the seas, but was forced into temporary pools and hypersaline lakes by the evolution of bony fishes.  Although they were previously considered the sister group to the remaining crustaceans, it is now widely accepted that crustaceans form a paraphyletic group, and Branchiopoda are thought to be sister to a clade comprising Xenocarida (Remipedia and Cephalocarida) and Hexapoda (insects and their relatives).

Her Roman equivalent is the goddess  .According to Hesiod\\'s Theogony, she was born when Cronus cut off Uranus\\'s genitals and threw them into the sea, and she arose from the sea foam (aphros).   According to Homer\\'s Iliad, she is the daughter of Zeus and Dione.Because of her beauty, other gods feared that their rivalry over her would interrupt the peace among them and lead to war, so Zeus married her to Hephaestus, who, because of his ugliness and deformity, was not seen as a threat. Aphrodite had many lovers—both gods, such as Ares, and men, such as Anchises. She played a role in the Eros and Psyche legend, and later was both Adonis\\'s lover and his surrogate mother. Many lesser beings were said to be children of Aphrodite. Aphrodite is also known as Cytherea (Lady of Cythera) and Cypris (Lady of Cyprus) after the two cult sites, Cythera and Cyprus, which claimed to be her place of birth.  Myrtle, doves, sparrows, horses, and swans were said to be sacred to her. The ancient Greeks identified her with the Ancient Egyptian goddess Hathor. Reginald Eldred Witt, Isis in the ancient world (Johns Hopkins University Press) 1997:125. ISBN 0-8018-5642-6 Aphrodite had many other names, such as Acidalia, Cytherea and Cerigo, each used by a different local cult of the goddess in Greece. The Greeks recognized all of these names as referring to the single goddess Aphrodite, despite the slight differences in what these local cults believed the goddess demanded of them. The Attic philosophers of the fourth century, however, drew a distinction between a celestial Aphrodite (Aprodite Urania) of transcendent principles, and a separate, \"common\" Aphrodite who was the goddess of the people (Aphrodite Pandemos). EtymologyThe archaic (Homeric) pronunciation of the name   was approximately  . In Koine Greek, this became  , changing further to   in Byzantine Greek by iotacism. The most common English pronunciation of Aphrodite is  .The etymology of Greek   is unknown.Hesiod connects it with   (aphros) \"foam,\" interpreting it as \"risen from the foam\". Other possible etymologies, many of them not Greek, have been suggested in scholarship. However, Janda (2010) considers the connection with \"foam\" genuine, and points to the story of Aphrodite\\'s birth, in which she arises from the sea foam after Cronus defeats Uranus, as a mytheme of Proto-Indo-European age.According to this interpretation, the name is from aphrós \"foam\" and déatai \"[she] seems\" or \"shines\" (infinitive form *déasthai ), meaning \"she who shines from the foam [ocean]\", a byname of the dawn goddess (Eos). Janda, Michael, Die Musik nach dem Chaos, Innsbruck 2010, p. 65  J.P. Mallory and D.Q. Adams (1997)  have also proposed an etymology based on the connection with the Indo-European dawn goddess, from   \"very\" and   \"to shine\".A number of possible non-Greek etymologies have been suggested in scholarship.The connection to Phoenician religion claimed by Herodotus (I.105,131) has inspired attempts to show that the Greek Aphrodite is derived from a Semitic word, Aštoret, by way of a hypothetical Hittite transmission, but these attempts have been inconclusive.Another proposed Semitic etymology compares Aphrodite to the Assyrian barīrītu, the name of a female demon that appears in Middle Babylonian and Late Babylonian texts. The name probably means \"she who (comes) at dusk,\" which would be an appropriate appellation for Aphrodite, given her role as the personification of the evening star—a role that, significantly, she shares with a parallell Mesopotamian goddess, Ishtar.Another non-Greek etymology, suggested by M. Hammarström,   looks to Etruscan, comparing (e)pruni \"lord\", an Etruscan  honorific loaned into Greek as πρύτανις. This would make the theonym in origin an honorific, \"the lady\".  Hjalmar Frisk rejects this etymology as implausible.The learned medieval work Etymologicum Magnum offers a pseudoetymology claiming that \"Aphrodite\" is derived from the compound   habrodiaitos (\"she who lives delicately\" from   habros +   diaita). The alteration from b to ph is explained as a \"familiar\" characteristic of Greek \"obvious from the Macedonians\".  Mythology Birth Aphrodite is usually said to have been born near her chief center of worship,  Paphos, on the island of Cyprus, which is why she is sometimes called \"Cyprian\", especially in the poetic works of Sappho. However, other versions of her myth have her born near the island of Cythera, hence another of her names, \"Cytherea\".  Cythera was a stopping place for trade and culture between Crete and the Peloponesus, so these stories may preserve traces of the migration of Aphrodite\\'s cult from the Middle East to mainland Greece.In the most famous version of her myth, her birth was the consequence of a castration: Cronus severed Uranus\\' genitals and threw them behind him into the sea. The foam from his genitals gave rise to Aphrodite (hence her name, meaning \"foam-arisen\"), while the Erinyes (furies) emerged from the drops of his blood. Hesiod states that the genitals \"were carried over the sea a long time, and white foam arose from the immortal flesh; with it a girl grew.\" The girl, Aphrodite, floated ashore on a scallop shell. This iconic representation of Aphrodite as a mature \"Venus rising from the sea\" (Venus Anadyomene ) was made famous in a much-admired painting by Apelles, now lost, but described in the Natural History of Pliny the Elder.In another version of her origin,  she was considered a daughter of Zeus and Dione, the mother goddess whose oracle was at Dodona. Aphrodite herself was sometimes also referred to as \"Dione\". \"Dione\" seems to be a feminine form of \"Dios\", the genitive form case of Zeus, and could be taken to mean simply \"the goddess\" in a generic sense. Aphrodite might, then, be an equivalent of Rhea, the Earth Mother, whom Homer relocated to Olympus. In Homer, Aphrodite ventures into battle to protect her son, Aeneas, is wounded by Diomedesk and returns to her mother to sink down at her knee and be comforted. AdulthoodAphrodite is consistently portrayed, in every image and story, as having had no childhood, and instead being born as a nubile, infinitely desirable adult. She is often depicted nude. In many of the later myths, she is portrayed as vain, ill-tempered and easily offended. Although she is married—she is one of the few gods in the Greek Pantheon who is—she is frequently unfaithful to her husband. Aphrodite\\'s husband Hephaestus is one of the most even-tempered of the Hellenic deities, but in the Odyssey she is portrayed as preferring Ares, the volatile god of war because she is attracted to his violent nature. Aphrodite is one of a few characters in the Odyssey  whose actions are a major contributing cause of the Trojan War: she offers Helen of Troy to Paris, and as the goddess of desire, she is responsible for Paris becoming so inflamed with desire for Helen at first sight that he is moved to abduct her.According to one version of Aphrodite\\'s story, because of her immense beauty Zeus fears that the other gods will become violent with each other in their rivalry to possess her. To forestall this, he forces her to marry Hephaestus, the dour, humorless god of smithing. In another version of the story, Aphrodite marries Hephaestus after his mother, Hera casts him off Olympus, deeming him too ugly and deformed to inhabit the home of the gods. His revenge is to trap his mother in a magic throne. In return for her release, he demands to be given Aphrodite\\'s hand in marriage. Hephaestus is overjoyed to be married to the goddess of beauty, and forges her beautiful jewelry, including the cestus, a girdle that makes her even more irresistible to men. Her unhappiness with her marriage causes Aphrodite to seek other male companionship, most often Ares, but also sometimes  Adonis. AdonisAphrodite was Adonis\\' lover and a surrogate mother to him. Cinyras, the King of Cyprus, had an intoxicatingly beautiful daughter named Myrrha. When Myrrha\\'s mother commits hubris against Aphrodite by claiming her daughter is more beautiful than the famed goddess, Myrrha is punished with a never-ending lust for her own father. Cinyras is repulsed by this, but Myrrha disguises herself as a prostitute, and secretly sleeps with her father at night. Eventually, Myrrha becomes pregnant and is discovered by Cinyras. In a rage, he chases her out of the house with a knife. Myrrha flees from him, praying to the gods for mercy as she runs. The gods hear her plea, and change her into a myrrh tree so her father cannot kill her. Eventually, Cinyras takes his own life in an attempt to restore the family\\'s honor.Myrrha gives birth to a baby boy named Adonis. Aphrodite happens by the myrrh tree and, seeing him, takes pity on the infant. She places Adonis in a box, and takes him down to Hades so Persephone can care for him. Adonis grows into a strikingly handsome young man, and Aphrodite eventually returns for him. Persephone, however, is loath to give him up, and wishes Adonis would stay with her in the underworld. The two goddesses begin such a quarrel, Zeus is forced to intercede. He decrees that Adonis will spend a third of the year with Aphrodite, a third of the year with Persephone, and a third of the year with whomever he wishes. Adonis, of course, chooses Aphrodite.Adonis begins his year on the earth with Aphrodite. One of his greatest passions is hunting, and although Aphrodite is not naturally a hunter, she takes up the sport just so she can be with him. They spend every waking hour with one another, and Aphrodite is enraptured with him. However, her anxiety begins to grow over her neglected duties, and she is forced to leave him for a short time. Before she leaves, she gives Adonis one warning: do not attack an animal which shows no fear. Adonis agrees to her advice, but, secretly doubting her skills as a huntress, quickly forgets her warning.Not long after Aphrodite leaves, Adonis comes across an enormous wild boar, much larger than any he has ever seen. It is suggested that the boar is the god Ares, one of Aphrodite\\'s lovers made jealous through her constant doting on Adonis. Although boars are dangerous and will charge a hunter if provoked, Adonis disregards Aphrodite\\'s warning and pursues the giant creature. Soon, however, Adonis is the one being pursued; he is no match for the giant boar. In the attack, Adonis is castrated by the boar, and dies from a loss of blood. Aphrodite rushes back to his side, but she is too late to save him and can only mourn over his body. Wherever Adonis\\' blood falls, Aphrodite causes anemones to grow in his memory. She vows that on the anniversary of his death, every year there will be a festival held in his honor.On his death, Adonis goes back to the underworld, and Persephone is delighted to see him again. Eventually, Aphrodite realizes he is there, and rushes back to retrieve him. Again, she and Persephone bicker over who is allowed to keep Adonis until Zeus intervenes. This time, he says Adonis must spend six months with Aphrodite and six months with Persephone, the way it should have been in the first place. The Judgement of Paris The gods and goddesses, as well as various mortals, were invited to the marriage of Peleus and Thetis (the eventual parents of Achilles). Only the goddess Eris (Discord) was not invited, but she arrived with a golden apple inscribed with the word kallistēi (\"to the fairest one\"), which she threw among the goddesses. Aphrodite, Hera, and Athena all claimed to be the fairest, and thus the rightful owner of the apple.The goddesses chose to place the matter before Zeus, who, not wanting to favor one of the goddesses, put the choice into the hands of Paris. After bathing in the spring of Mount Ida (where Troy was situated), the goddesses appeared before Paris. Paris, having been given permission by Zeus to set any conditions he saw fit, required the goddesses to undress and allow him to see them naked. (Another version of the myth says the goddesses themselves chose to undress.) Still, Paris could not decide, as all three were ideally beautiful, so the goddesses resorted to bribes. Hera tried to bribe Paris with control over all Asia and Europe, while Athena offered wisdom, fame, and glory in battle, and Aphrodite offered the most beautiful mortal woman in the world as a wife, and he accordingly chose her. This woman was Helen, who was, unfortunately for Paris, already married to King Menelaus of Sparta. The other two goddesses were enraged by this, and through Helen\\'s abduction by Paris, they brought about the Trojan War.

He scorned the worship of Aphrodite for Artemis and, in revenge, Aphrodite caused his stepmother, Phaedra, to fall in love with him, knowing Hippolytus would reject her.In the most popular version of the story, as told in the play Hippolytus by Euripides, Phaedra seeks revenge against Hippolytus by killing herself and, in her suicide note, tells Theseus, her husband and Hippolytus\\' father, that Hippolytus had raped her. Hippolytus was oath-bound not to mention Phaedra\\'s love for him and nobly refused to defend himself despite the consequences. Theseus then cursed his son, a curse Poseidon was bound to fulfill, so Hippolytus was laid low by a bull from the sea that caused his chariot-team to panic and wreck his vehicle. Hippolytus forgives his father before he dies and Artemis reveals the truth to Theseus before vowing to kill the one Aphrodite loves (Adonis) for revenge.Glaucus of Corinth angered Aphrodite. When he was competing in the chariot race at the funeral games of King Pelias she drove his horses mad and they tore him apart. His ghost was said to frighten horses during the Isthmian Games. In one Greek myth, Aphrodite placed the curse of snakes for hair and the stone-gaze upon Medusa and her sisters. Aphrodite was jealous of the three sisters\\' beauty, and she grew so jealous, she cursed them. Forms of Aphrodite  By the late 5th century BC, certain philosophers had begun to draw a distinction between two separate \"Aphrodites\" (as opposed to a single Aphrodite whose characteristics varied slightly in different local cults of the goddess): Aphrodite Ourania, the celestial Aphrodite, born from the sea foam after Cronus castrated Uranus, and Aphrodite Pandemos, the common Aphrodite \"of all the folk\", born from the union of Zeus and Dione.  Among the neo-Platonists and, later, their Christian interpreters, Aphrodite Ourania is associated with spiritual love, and Aphrodite Pandemos with physical love (desire). A representation of Aphrodite Ourania with her foot resting on a tortoise came to be seen as emblematic of discretion in conjugal love. (We know of this representation, said to have been a chryselephantine sculpture made by Phidias for Elis, only from a parenthetical comment by the geographer Pausanias). Plato, in his Symposium,  has one of his characters, an Athenian named Pausanias (no relation to the geographer Pausanias), describe Aphrodite as two goddesses, one older, the other younger. The older one, Urania, is the daughter of Uranus, and inspires homosexual male (and more specifically, ephebic) love/eros; the younger is named Pandemos, the daughter of Zeus and Dione, and all love for women comes from her. The speech of Pausanias distinguishes two manifestations of Aphrodite, represented by the two stories: Aphrodite Ourania (\"heavenly\" Aphrodite), and Aphrodite Pandemos (\"Common\" Aphrodite). Aphrodite is also known as Areia , showing her connection to Ares, the god of war, whom she had extramarital relations with. As a result, she was, to some extent, made into a goddess of war. This is especially true in Sparta. Comparative mythology Ancient Near Eastern parallelsThe religions of the Ancient Near East have a number of love goddesses that can be argued to be similar to certain aspects of Aphrodite.Her cult in Greece was imported from, or influenced by, the cult of Astarte in Phoenicia.Hans Georg Wunderlich further connects Aphrodite with the Minoan snake goddess. The Egyptian snake goddess Wadjet was associated with the city known to the Greeks as Aphroditopolis (the city of Aphrodite). Pausanias states the first to establish a cult of Aphrodite were the Assyrians, after the Assyrians the Paphians of Cyprus and then the Phoenicians at Ascalon. The Phoenicians, in turn, taught her worship to the people of Cythera. An origin of (or significant influence on) the Greek love goddess from Near Eastern traditions was seen with some skepticism in classical 19th century scholarship. Authors such as A. Enmann (Kypros und der Ursprung des Aphroditekultes 1881) attempted to portray the cult of Aphrodite as a native Greek development.Scholarly opinion on this question has shifted significantly since the 1980s, notably due to Walter Burkert (1984), and the significant influence of the Near East on early Greek religion in general (and on the cult of Aphrodite in particular) is now widely recognized as dating to a period of orientalization during the eightth century BC, when archaic Greece was on the fringes of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. In native Greek tradition, the planet had two names, Hesperos as the evening star and Eosphoros as the morning star. The Greeks adopted the identification of the morning and the evening stars, as well as its identification as Ishtar/Aphrodite, during the fourth century BC, along with other items of Babylonian astrology, such as the zodiac (Eudoxus of Cnidus). Comparison with the Indo-European dawn goddessIt has long been accepted in comparative mythology that Aphrodite (regardless of possible oriental influences) preserves some aspects of the Indo-European dawn goddess  (properly Greek Eos, Latin  Aurora, Sanskrit Ushas). Janda (2010) etymologizes her name as \"she who rises from the foam [of the ocean]\" and points to Hesiod\\'s Theogony account of Aphrodite\\'s birth as an archaic reflex of Indo-European myth.  Aphrodite rising out of the waters after Cronus defeats Uranus as a mytheme   would then be directly cognate to the Rigvedic myth of Indra defeating Vrtra, liberating Ushas.  Cult of AphroditeThe epithet Aphrodite Acidalia was occasionally added to her name, after the spring she used for bathing, located in Boeotia (Virgil I, 720).  She was also called Kypris or Cytherea after her birth-places in Cyprus and Cythera, respectively, both centers of her cult. She was associated with Hesperia and frequently accompanied by the Oreads, nymphs of the mountains. Her festival, Aphrodisia, was celebrated across Greece, but particularly in Athens and Corinth. At the temple of Aphrodite on the summit of Acrocorinth (before the Roman destruction of the city in 146 BC), intercourse with her priestesses was considered a method of worshiping Aphrodite. This temple was not rebuilt when the city was re-established under Roman rule in 44 BC, but the fertility rituals likely continued in the main city near the agora.Aphrodite was associated with, and often depicted with, the sea, dolphins, doves, swans, pomegranates, sceptres, apples, myrtle, rose trees, lime trees, clams, scallop shells, and pearls.One aspect of the cult of Aphrodite and her precedents that Thomas Bulfinch\\'s much-reprinted The Age of Fable; or Stories of Gods and Heroes (1855 etc.) elided  was the practice of ritual prostitution in her shrines and temples. The euphemism in Greek is hierodoule, \"sacred slave.\" The practice was an inherent part of the rituals owed to Aphrodite\\'s Near Eastern forebears, Sumerian Inanna and Akkadian Ishtar, whose temple priestesses were the \"women of Ishtar,\" ishtaritum.  The practice has been documented in Babylon, Syria and Palestine, in Phoenician cities and the Tyrian colony Carthage, and for Hellenic Aphrodite in Cyprus, the center of her cult, Cythera, Corinth and in Sicily (Marcovich 1996:49); the practice however is not attested in Athens. Aphrodite was everywhere the patroness of the hetaera and courtesan. In Ionia on the coast of Asia Minor, hierodoulai served in the temple of Artemis.

It consists of the Jutland peninsula and several islands in the Baltic sea, referred to as the Danish Archipelago. Denmark is located southwest of Sweden and due south of Norway and is bordered by the German state (and former possession) Schleswig-Holstein to the south.Denmark borders both the Baltic and North Seas along its   tidal shoreline. Denmark's general coastline is muc69h shorter, at  , as it would, among other geographical features, not include most of the 1,419 offshore islands (each defined as exceeding 100 square meters in area) and the 180\\xa0km long Limfjorden, which separates Denmark's second largest island, North Jutlandic Island, 4,686\\xa0km 2  in size, from the rest of Jutland. Denmark has 443 named islands,  of which 72 are inhabited ( , Statistics Denmark). Denmark experiences a temperate climate. This means that the winters are mild and windy and the summers are cool. The local terrain is generally flat wi69th a few gently rolling plains. The territory of Denmark includes the island of Bornholm in the Baltic Sea and the rest of metropolitan Denmark, but excludes the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Its position gives Denmark complete control of the Danish Straits (Skagerrak and Kattegat) linking Baltic and North Seas.

It is the amount of energy needed to heat one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. In scientific contexts the Btu has largely been replaced by the SI unit of energy, the joule.The unit is most often used as a measure of power (as Btu/h) in the power, steam generation, heating and air conditioning industries, and also as a measure of agricultural energy production (Btu/kg).  It is still used in metric English-speaking countries (such as Canada), and remains the standard unit of classification for air conditioning units manufactured and sold in many non-English-speaking metric countries.  In North America, the term \"Btu\" is used to describe the heat value (energy content) of fuels. DefinitionsA Btu is defined as amount of heat required to raise the temperature of   of liquid water by   at a constant pressure of one atmosphere.  As is the case with the calorie, several different definitions of the Btu exist, which are based on different water temperatures and therefore vary by up to 0.5%. A Btu can be approximated as the heat produced by burning a single wooden match  or as the amount of energy it would take to lift a one-pound weight to a height of  .

This is easily confused with the SI mega (M) prefix, which multiplies by a factor of one million (1,000,000). To avoid confusion many companies and engineers use MMBtu to represent one million Btu. Alternatively a therm is used representing 100,000 or 10 5 \\xa0Btu, and a quad as 10 15 \\xa0Btu. Some companies also use BtuE6 in order to reduce confusion between a thousand Btu vs. a million Btu.

Quads are used in the United States for representing the annual energy consumption of large economies: for example, the U.S. economy used 99.75 quads in 2005.  One quad/year is about 33.43 gigawatts. The Btu should not be confused with the Board of Trade Unit (B.O.T.U.), which is a much larger quantity of energy (1\\xa0kW·h, or about 3412\\xa0Btu).The Btu is often used to express the conversion-efficiency of heat into electrical energy in power plants.

It operates as a network comprising both a multinational, stateless army  . \"Al-Qaeda\\'s global network, as we know it today, was created while it was based in Khartoum, from December 1991 till May 1996. To coordinate its overt and covert operations as al-Qaeda\\'s ambitions and resources increased, it developed a decentralized, regional structure. [...] As a global multinational, al-Qaeda makes its constituent nationalities and ethnic groups, of which there are several dozen, responsible for a particular geographic region. Although its modus operandi is cellular, familial relationships play a key role.\"  See also:    and a radical Sunni Muslim movement calling for global Jihad and a strict interpretation of sharia law. It has been designated as a terrorist organization by the United Nations Security Council, NATO, the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and various other countries (see below). Al-Qaeda has carried out several attacks on non-Muslims,   and other targets it considers kafir.  Al-Qaeda has attacked civilian and military targets in various countries, including the September 11 attacks, 1998 U.S. embassy bombings and the 2002 Bali bombings. The U.S. government responded to the September 11 attacks by launching the War on Terror. With the loss of key leaders, culminating in the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaeda\\'s operations have devolved from  actions that were controlled from the top-down, to actions by franchise associated groups, to actions of lone wolf operators.Characteristic techniques employed by al-Qaeda include suicide attacks and simultaneous bombings of different targets.  Activities ascribed to it may involve members of the movement, who have taken a pledge of loyalty to Osama bin Laden, or the much more numerous \"al-Qaeda-linked\" individuals who have undergone training in one of its camps in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq or Sudan, but who have not taken any pledge.  Al-Qaeda ideologues envision a complete break from all foreign influences in Muslim countries, and the creation of a new world-wide Islamic caliphate.    Among the beliefs ascribed to Al-Qaeda members is the conviction that a Christian–Jewish alliance is conspiring to destroy Islam.  As Salafist jihadists, they believe that the killing of civilians is religiously sanctioned, and they ignore any aspect of religious scripture which might be interpreted as forbidding the murder of civilians and internecine fighting.     Al-Qaeda also opposes man-made laws, and wants to replace them with a strict form of sharia law.   Al-Qaeda is also responsible for instigating sectarian violence among Muslims.  Al-Qaeda is intolerant of non-Sunni branches of Islam and denounces them by means of excommunications called \"takfir\". Al-Qaeda leaders regard liberal Muslims, Shias, Sufis and other sects as heretics and have attacked their mosques and gatherings.  Examples of sectarian attacks include the Yazidi community bombings, the Sadr City bombings, the Ashoura Massacre and the April 2007 Baghdad bombings.  OrganizationAl-Qaeda\\'s management philosophy has been described as \"centralization of decision and decentralization of execution.\"  It is thought that al-Qaeda\\'s leadership, following the War on Terror, has \"become geographically isolated\", leading to the \"emergence of decentralized leadership\" of regional groups using the al-Qaeda \"brand\".  Many terrorism experts do not believe that the global jihadist movement is driven at every level by al-Qaeda\\'s leadership. Although bin Laden still held considerable ideological sway over some Muslim extremists before his death, experts argue that al-Qaeda has fragmented over the years into a variety of regional movements that have little connection with one another. Marc Sageman, a psychiatrist and former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer, said that al-Qaeda is now just a \"loose label for a movement that seems to target the West\". \"There is no umbrella organisation. We like to create a mythical entity called [al-Qaeda] in our minds, but that is not the reality we are dealing with.\"   This view mirrors the account given by Osama bin Laden in his October 2001 interview with Tayseer Allouni: \"...this matter isn\\'t about any specific person and...is not about the al-Qai`dah Organization. We are the children of an Islamic Nation, with Prophet Muhammad as its leader, our Lord is one...and all the true believers [mu\\'mineen] are brothers. So the situation isn\\'t like the West portrays it, that there is an \\'organization\\' with a specific name (such as \\'al-Qai`dah\\') and so on. That particular name is very old. It was born without any intention from us. Brother Abu Ubaida... created a military base to train the young men to fight against the vicious, arrogant, brutal, terrorizing Soviet empire... So this place was called \\'The Base\\' [\\'Al-Qai`dah\\'], as in a training base, so this name grew and became. We aren\\'t separated from this nation. We are the children of a nation, and we are an inseparable part of it, and from those public demonstrations which spread from the far east, from the Philippines, to Indonesia, to Malaysia, to India, to Pakistan, reaching Mauritania... and so we discuss the conscience of this nation.\"    Others, however, see al-Qaeda as an integrated network that is strongly led from the Pakistani tribal areas and has a powerful strategic purpose. Bruce Hoffman, a terrorism expert at Georgetown University, said \"It amazes me that people don\\'t think there is a clear adversary out there, and that our adversary does not have a strategic approach.\" Al-Qaeda has the following direct affiliates:   Al-Qaeda in Iraq Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb Al-Shabaab (Mujahideen Youth Movement) in Somalia Egyptian Islamic Jihad Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which comprises Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia, and Islamic Jihad of Yemen   Leadership Information mostly acquired from Jamal al-Fadl provided American authorities with a rough picture of how the group was organized. While the veracity of the information provided by al-Fadl and the motivation for his cooperation are both disputed, American authorities base much of their current knowledge of al-Qaeda on his testimony.  . Osama bin Laden was the most historically notable emir, or commander, and Senior Operations Chief of al-Qaida prior to his assassination on May 1, 2011 by US forces. Ayman al-Zawahiri, al-Qaeda\\'s Deputy Operations Chief prior to bin Laden\\'s death, assumed the role of commander, according to an announcement by al-Qaida on June 16, 2011. He replaced Saif al-Adel, who had served as interim commander. Bin Laden was advised by a Shura Council, which consists of senior al-Qaeda members, estimated by Western officials to consist of 20–30 people.Atiyah Abd al-Rahman was alleged to be second in command prior to his death on August 22, 2011. On 5 June 2012, Pakistan intelligence officials announced that al-Rahman\\'s replacement Abu Yahya al-Libi had been killed in Pakistan. Al-Qaeda\\'s network was built from scratch as a conspiratorial network that draws on leaders of all its regional nodes \"as and when necessary to serve as an integral part of its high command.\"  The Military Committee is responsible for training operatives, acquiring weapons, and planning attacks. The Money/Business Committee funds the recruitment and training of operatives through the hawala banking system. U.S-led efforts to eradicate the sources of terrorist financing  were most successful in the year immediately following the September 11 attacks;  al-Qaeda continues to operate through unregulated banks, such as the 1,000 or so hawaladars in Pakistan, some of which can handle deals of up to $10\\xa0million.  It also provides air tickets and false passports, pays al-Qaeda members, and oversees profit-driven businesses. Businesses are run from below, with the council only being consulted on new proposals and collecting funds.  See:  .  In the 9/11 Commission Report, it was estimated that al-Qaeda required $30\\xa0million-per-year to conduct its operations. The Law Committee reviews Sharia law, and decides whether particular courses of action conform to it. The Islamic Study/Fatwah Committee issues religious edicts, such as an edict in 1998 telling Muslims to kill Americans. In the late 1990s there was a publicly known Media Committee, which ran the now-defunct newspaper Nashrat al Akhbar (Newscast) and handled public relations. In 2005, al-Qaeda formed As-Sahab, a media production house, to supply its video and audio materials. Command structureWhen asked about the possibility of al-Qaeda\\'s connection to the July 7, 2005 London bombings in 2005, Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Ian Blair said: \"Al-Qaeda is not an organization. Al-Qaeda is a way of working ... but this has the hallmark of that approach ... al-Qaeda clearly has the ability to provide training ... to provide expertise ... and I think that is what has occurred here.\"   On August 13, 2005, however, The Independent newspaper, quoting police and MI5 investigations, reported that the July 7 bombers had acted independently of an al-Qaeda terror mastermind someplace abroad. What exactly al-Qaeda is, or was, remains in dispute. Author and journalist Adam Curtis argues that the idea of al-Qaeda as a formal organization is primarily an American invention. Curtis contends the name \"al-Qaeda\" was first brought to the attention of the public in the 2001 trial of bin Laden and the four men accused of the 1998 US embassy bombings in East Africa: The reality was that bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri had become the focus of a loose association of disillusioned Islamist militants who were attracted by the new strategy. But there was no organization. These were militants who mostly planned their own operations and looked to bin Laden for funding and assistance. He was not their commander. There is also no evidence that bin Laden used the term \"al-Qaeda\" to refer to the name of a group until after September 11 attacks, when he realized that this was the term the Americans had given it. The Power of Nightmares, BBC Documentary.  As a matter of law, the US Department of Justice needed to show that bin Laden was the leader of a criminal organization in order to charge him in absentia under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also known as the RICO statutes. The name of the organization and details of its structure were provided in the testimony of Jamal al-Fadl, who said he was a founding member of the organization and a former employee of bin Laden.  Questions about the reliability of al-Fadl\\'s testimony have been raised by a number of sources because of his history of dishonesty, and because he was delivering it as part of a plea bargain agreement after being convicted of conspiring to attack U.S. military establishments.   Sam Schmidt, one of his defense lawyers, said: There were selective portions of al-Fadl\\'s testimony that I believe was false, to help support the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied in a number of specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.   Field operativesThe number of individuals in the organization who have undergone proper military training, and are capable of commanding insurgent forces, is largely unknown. In 2006, it was estimated that al-Qaeda had several thousand commanders embedded in 40 different countries.  .  As of 2009, it was believed that no more than 200–300 members were still active commanders. According to the award-winning 2004 BBC documentary The Power of Nightmares, al-Qaeda was so weakly linked together that it was hard to say it existed apart from bin Laden and a small clique of close associates. The lack of any significant numbers of convicted al-Qaeda members, despite a large number of arrests on terrorism charges, was cited by the documentary as a reason to doubt whether a widespread entity that met the description of al-Qaeda existed.  Insurgent forcesAccording to Robert Cassidy, al-Qaeda controls two separate forces deployed alongside insurgents in Iraq and Pakistan. The first, numbering in the tens of thousands, was \"organized, trained, and equipped as insurgent combat forces\" in the Soviet-Afghan war.  It was made up primarily of foreign mujahideen from Saudi Arabia and Yemen. Many went on to fight in Bosnia and Somalia for global jihad. Another group, approximately 10,000 strong, live in Western states and have received rudimentary combat training. Other analysts have described al-Qaeda\\'s rank and file as being \"predominantly Arab,\" in its first years of operation, and now also includes  \"other peoples\" as of 2007.  It has been estimated that 62% of al-Qaeda members have university education.  FinancingSome financing for al-Qaeda in the 1990s came from the personal wealth of Osama bin Laden. Who is Bin Laden? retrieved May 5, 2011  By 2001 Afghanistan had become politically complex and mired. With many financial sources for al-Qaeda Bin Laden\\'s financing role may have become comparatively minor. Sources in 2001 could also have included Jamaa Al-Islamiyya and Islamic Jihad, both associated with Afghan-based Egyptians.  Other sources of income in 2001 included the heroin trade and donations from supporters in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and other Islamic countries.  A WikiLeaks released memo from the United States Secretary of State sent in 2009 asserted that the primary source of funding of Sunni terrorist groups worldwide was Saudi Arabia.  StrategyOn March 11, 2005, Al-Quds Al-Arabi published extracts from Saif al-Adel\\'s document \"Al Quaeda\\'s Strategy to the Year 2020\".     Abdel Bari Atwan summarizes this strategy as comprising five stages to rid the Ummah from all forms of oppression: Provoke the United States and the West into invading a Muslim country by staging a massive attack or string of attacks on U.S. soil that results in massive civilian casualties. Incite local resistance to occupying forces. Expand the conflict to neighboring countries, and engage the U.S. and its allies in a long war of attrition. Convert al-Qaeda into an ideology and set of operating principles that can be loosely franchised in other countries without requiring direct command and control, and via these franchises incite attacks against the U.S. and countries allied with the U.S. until they withdraw from the conflict, as happened with the 2004 Madrid train bombings, but which did not have the same effect with the July 7, 2005 London bombings. The U.S. economy will finally collapse by the year 2020 under the strain of multiple engagements in numerous places, making the worldwide economic system which is dependent on the U.S. also collapse leading to global political instability, which in turn leads to a global jihad led by al-Qaeda and a Wahhabi Caliphate will then be installed across the world following the collapse of the U.S. and the rest of the Western world countries. Atwan also noted, regarding the collapse of the U.S., \"If this sounds far-fetched, it is sobering to consider that this virtually describes the downfall of the Soviet Union.\"  EtymologyIn Arabic, al-Qaeda has four syllables ( ,   or  ). However, since two of the Arabic consonants in the name (the voiceless uvular plosive   and the voiced pharyngeal fricative  ) are not phones found in the English language, the closest naturalized English pronunciations include  ,   and  .  al-Qaeda\\'s name can also be transliterated as al-Qaida, al-Qa\\'ida, el-Qaida, or al-Qaeda. The name comes from the Arabic noun qā\\'idah, which means foundation or basis, and can also refer to a military base. The initial al- is the Arabic definite article the, hence the base. Bin Laden explained the origin of the term in a videotaped interview with Al Jazeera journalist Tayseer Alouni in October 2001:  The name \\'al-Qaeda\\' was established a long time ago by mere chance. The late Abu Ebeida El-Banashiri established the training camps for our mujahedeen against Russia\\'s terrorism. We used to call the training camp al-Qaeda. The name stayed.  It has been argued that two documents seized from the Sarajevo office of the Benevolence International Foundation prove that the name was not simply adopted by the mujahid movement and that a group called al-Qaeda was established in August 1988. Both of these documents contain minutes of meetings held to establish a new military group, and contain the term \"al-Qaeda\". Former British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wrote that the word al-Qaeda should be translated as \"the database\", and originally referred to the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen militants who were recruited and trained with CIA help to defeat the Russians.  In April 2002, the group assumed the name Qa\\'idat al-Jihad, which means \"the base of Jihad\". According to Diaa Rashwan, this was \"apparently as a result of the merger of the overseas branch of Egypt\\'s al-Jihad (Egyptian Islamist Jihad, or EIJ) group, led by Ayman al-Zawahiri, with the groups Bin Laden brought under his control after his return to Afghanistan in the mid-1990s.\"  Ideology    The radical Islamist movement in general and al-Qaeda in particular developed during the Islamic revival and Islamist movement of the last three decades of the 20th century, along with less extreme movements.Some have argued that \"without the writings\" of Islamic author and thinker Sayyid Qutb, \"al-Qaeda would not have existed.\"  Qutb preached that because of the lack of sharia law, the Muslim world was no longer Muslim, having reverted to pre-Islamic ignorance known as jahiliyyah.To restore Islam, he said a vanguard movement of righteous Muslims was needed to establish \"true Islamic states\", implement sharia, and rid the Muslim world of any non-Muslim influences, such as concepts like socialism and nationalism. Enemies of Islam in Qutb\\'s view included \"treacherous Orientalists\"  and \"world Jewry\", who plotted \"conspiracies\" and \"wicked[ly]\" opposed Islam.In the words of Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, a close college friend of bin Laden:  Islam is different from any other religion; it\\'s a way of life. We [Khalifa and bin Laden] were trying to understand what Islam has to say about how we eat, who we marry, how we talk. We read Sayyid Qutb. He was the one who most affected our generation.  Qutb had an even greater influence on bin Laden\\'s mentor and another leading member of al-Qaeda,  Ayman al-Zawahiri. Zawahiri\\'s uncle and maternal family patriarch, Mafouz Azzam, was Qutb\\'s student, then protégé, then personal lawyer, and finally executor of his estate—one of the last people to see Qutb before his execution. \"Young Ayman al-Zawahiri heard again and again from his beloved uncle Mahfouz about the purity of Qutb\\'s character and the torment he had endured in prison.\"  Zawahiri paid homage to Qutb in his work Knights under the Prophet\\'s Banner. One of the most powerful of Qutb\\'s ideas was that many who said they were Muslims were not. Rather, they were apostates. That not only gave jihadists \"a legal loophole around the prohibition of killing another Muslim,\" but made \"it a religious obligation to execute\" these self-professed Muslims. These alleged apostates included leaders of Muslim countries, since they failed to enforce sharia law.  Religious compatibilityAbdel Bari Atwan writes that:   History  Researchers   have described five distinct phases in the development of al-Qaeda: the beginning in the late 1980s, the \"wilderness\" period in 1990–96, its \"heyday\" in 1996–2001, the network period of 2001–05, and a period of fragmentation from 2005 to today.  Jihad in Afghanistan  The origins of al-Qaeda as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the Soviet War in Afghanistan (December 1979 – February 1989).  The U.S. viewed the conflict in Afghanistan, with the Afghan Marxists and allied Soviet troops on one side and the native Afghan mujahideen, some of whom were radical Islamic militants, on the other, as a blatant case of Soviet expansionism and aggression. A CIA program called Operation Cyclone channeled funds through Pakistan\\'s Inter-Services Intelligence agency to the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting the Soviet occupation.   At the same time, a growing number of Arab mujahideen joined the jihad against the Afghan Marxist regime, facilitated by international Muslim organizations, particularly the Maktab al-Khidamat,    which was funded by the Saudi Arabia government as well as by individual Muslims (particularly Saudi businessmen who were approached by bin Laden). Together, these sources donated some $600\\xa0million a year to jihad.  In 1984 Maktab al-Khidamat (MAK), or the \"Services Office\", a Muslim organization founded to raise and channel funds and recruit foreign mujahideen for the war against the Soviets in Afghanistan, was established in Peshawar, Pakistan, by bin Laden and Abdullah Yusuf Azzam, a Palestinian Islamic scholar and member of the Muslim Brotherhood. MAK organized guest houses in Peshawar, near the Afghan border, and gathered supplies for the construction of paramilitary training camps to prepare foreign recruits for the Afghan war front. Bin Laden became a \"major financier\" of the mujahideen, spending his own money and using his connections with \"the Saudi royal family and the petro-billionaires of the Gulf\" to influence public opinion about the war and raise additional funds.  From 1986, MAK began to set up a network of recruiting offices in the U.S., the hub of which was the Al Kifah Refugee Center at the Farouq Mosque on Brooklyn\\'s Atlantic Avenue. Among notable figures at the Brooklyn center were \"double agent\" Ali Mohamed, whom FBI special agent Jack Cloonan called \"bin Laden\\'s first trainer,\"  and \"Blind Sheikh\" Omar Abdel-Rahman, a leading recruiter of mujahideen for Afghanistan. Al-Qaeda evolved from MAK.Azzam and bin Laden began to establish camps in Afghanistan in 1987. U.S. government financial support for the Afghan Islamic militants was substantial. Aid to Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, an Afghan mujahideen leader. and founder and leader of the Hezb-e Islami radical Islamic militant faction, alone amounted \"by the most conservative estimates\" to $600\\xa0million. Later, in the early 1990s, after the U.S. had withdrawn support, Hekmatyar \"worked closely\" with bin Laden.  In addition to receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in American aid, Hekmatyar was the recipient of the lion\\'s share of Saudi aid.  There is evidence that the CIA supported Hekmatyar\\'s drug trade activities by giving him immunity for his opium trafficking, which financed the operation of his militant faction. Interview with Alfred McCoy, November 9, 1991 by Paul DeRienzo  MAK and foreign mujahideen volunteers, or \"Afghan Arabs,\" did not play a major role in the war. While over 250,000 Afghan mujahideen fought the Soviets and the communist Afghan government, it is estimated that were never more than 2,000 foreign mujahideen in the field at any one time.  Nonetheless, foreign mujahideen volunteers came from 43 countries, and the total number that participated in the Afghan movement between 1982 and 1992 is reported to have been 35,000.    Bin Laden played a central role in organizing training camps for the foreign Muslim volunteers.  The Soviet Union finally withdrew from Afghanistan in 1989. To the surprise of many, Mohammad Najibullah\\'s communist Afghan government hung on for three more years, before being overrun by elements of the mujahideen. With mujahideen leaders unable to agree on a structure for governance, chaos ensued, with constantly reorganizing alliances fighting for control of ill-defined territories, leaving the country devastated. Expanding operations    Toward the end of the Soviet military mission in Afghanistan, some mujahideen wanted to expand their operations to include Islamist struggles in other parts of the world, such as Israel and Kashmir. A number of overlapping and interrelated organizations were formed, to further those aspirations.One of these was the organization that would eventually be called al-Qaeda, formed by bin Laden with an initial meeting held on August 11, 1988.   Notes of a meeting of bin Laden and others on August 20, 1988, indicate al-Qaeda was a formal group by that time: \"basically an organized Islamic faction, its goal is to lift the word of God, to make His religion victorious.\" A list of requirements for membership itemized the following: listening ability, good manners, obedience, and making a pledge (bayat) to follow one\\'s superiors. According to Wright, the group\\'s real name wasn\\'t used in public pronouncements because \"its existence was still a closely held secret.\"  His research suggests that al-Qaeda was formed at an August 11, 1988, meeting between \"several senior leaders\" of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, Abdullah Azzam, and bin Laden, where it was agreed to join bin Laden\\'s money with the expertise of the Islamic Jihad organization and take up the jihadist cause elsewhere after the Soviets withdrew from Afghanistan.  . Bin Laden wished to establish non-military operations in other parts of the world; Azzam, in contrast, wanted to remain focused on military campaigns. After Azzam was assassinated in 1989, the MAK split, with a significant number joining bin Laden\\'s organization.In November 1989, Ali Mohamed, a former special forces Sergeant stationed at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, left military service and moved to California. He traveled to Afghanistan and Pakistan and became \"deeply involved with bin Laden\\'s plans.\" A year later, on November 8, 1990, the FBI raided the New Jersey home of Ali Mohammed\\'s associate El Sayyid Nosair, discovering a great deal of evidence of terrorist plots, including plans to blow up New York City skyscrapers.  Nosair was eventually convicted in connection to the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, and for the murder of Rabbi Meir Kahane on November 5, 1990. In 1991, Ali Mohammed is said to have helped orchestrate bin Laden\\'s relocation to Sudan.  Gulf War and the start of U.S. enmity Following the Soviet Union\\'s withdrawal from Afghanistan in February 1989, bin Laden returned to Saudi Arabia. The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had put the Kingdom and its ruling House of Saud at risk. The world\\'s most valuable oil fields were within easy striking distance of Iraqi forces in Kuwait, and Saddam\\'s call to pan-Arab/Islamism could potentially rally internal dissent.In the face of a seemingly massive Iraqi military presence, Saudi Arabia\\'s own forces were well armed but far outnumbered. Bin Laden offered the services of his mujahideen to King Fahd to protect Saudi Arabia from the Iraqi army. The Saudi monarch refused bin Laden\\'s offer, opting instead to allow U.S. and allied forces to deploy troops into Saudi territory. The deployment angered Bin Laden, as he believed the presence of foreign troops in the \"land of the two mosques\" (Mecca and Medina) profaned sacred soil. After speaking publicly against the Saudi government for harboring American troops, he was banished and forced to live in exile in Sudan. SudanFrom around 1992 to 1996, al-Qaeda and bin Laden based themselves in Sudan at the invitation of Islamist theoretician Hassan al Turabi. The move followed an Islamist coup d\\'état in Sudan, led by Colonel Omar al-Bashir, who professed a commitment to reordering Muslim political values. During this time, bin Laden assisted the Sudanese government, bought or set up various business enterprises, and established camps where insurgents trained.A key turning point for bin Laden, further pitting him against the Sauds, occurred in 1993 when Saudi Arabia gave support for the Oslo Accords, which set a path for peace between Israel and Palestinians. Zawahiri and the EIJ, who served as the core of al-Qaeda but also engaged in separate operations against the Egyptian government, had bad luck in Sudan. In 1993, a young schoolgirl was killed in an unsuccessful EIJ attempt on the life of the Egyptian prime minister, Atef Sedki. Egyptian public opinion turned against Islamist bombings, and the police arrested 280 of al-Jihad\\'s members and executed 6. Due to bin Laden\\'s continuous verbal assault on King Fahd of Saudi Arabia, on March 5, 1994 Fahd sent an emissary to Sudan demanding bin Laden\\'s passport; bin Laden\\'s Saudi citizenship was also revoked. His family was persuaded to cut off his monthly stipend, $7\\xa0million ($  today) a year, and his Saudi assets were frozen.     His family publicly disowned him. There is controversy over whether and to what extent he continued to garner support from members of his family and/or the Saudi government.   In June 1995 an even more ill-fated attempt to assassinate Egyptian president Mubarak led to the expulsion of EIJ, and in May 1996, of bin Laden, by the Sudanese government.According to Pakistani-American businessman Mansoor Ijaz, the Sudanese government offered the Clinton Administration numerous opportunities to arrest bin Laden. Those opportunities were met positively by Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, but spurned when Susan Rice and counter-terrorism czar Richard Clarke persuaded National Security Advisor Sandy Berger to overrule Albright. Ijaz’s claims appeared in numerous Op-Ed pieces, including one in the Los Angeles Times  and one in The Washington Post co-written with former Ambassador to Sudan Timothy M. Carney.  Similar allegations have been made by Vanity Fair contributing editor David Rose,  and Richard Miniter, author of Losing bin Laden, in a November 2003 interview with World. Several sources dispute Ijaz\\'s claim, including the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the U.S. (the 9–11 Commission), which concluded in part:  Sudan\\'s minister of defense, Fatih Erwa, has claimed that Sudan offered to hand Bin Ladin over to the U.S. The Commission has found no credible evidence that this was so. Ambassador Carney had instructions only to push the Sudanese to expel Bin Ladin. Ambassador Carney had no legal basis to ask for more from the Sudanese since, at the time, there was no indictment out-standing.   Refuge in Afghanistan After the Soviet withdrawal, Afghanistan was effectively ungoverned for seven years and plagued by constant infighting between former allies and various mujahideen groups.Throughout the 1990s, a new force began to emerge. The origins of the Taliban (literally \"students\") lay in the children of Afghanistan, many of them orphaned by the war, and many of whom had been educated in the rapidly expanding network of Islamic schools (madrassas) either in Kandahar or in the refugee camps on the Afghan-Pakistani border.According to Ahmed Rashid, five leaders of the Taliban were graduates of Darul Uloom Haqqania, a madrassa in the small town of Akora Khattak.  .  The town is situated near Peshawar in Pakistan, but largely attended by Afghan refugees.  This institution reflected Salafi beliefs in its teachings, and much of its funding came from private donations from wealthy Arabs. Bin Laden\\'s contacts were still laundering most of these donations, using \"unscrupulous\" Islamic banks to transfer the money to an \"array\" of charities which serve as front groups for al-Qaeda, or transporting cash-filled suitcases straight into Pakistan.  Another four of the Taliban\\'s leaders attended a similarly funded and influenced madrassa in Kandahar.Many of the mujahideen who later joined the Taliban fought alongside Afghan warlord Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi\\'s Harkat i Inqilabi group at the time of the Russian invasion. This group also enjoyed the loyalty of most Afghan Arab fighters.The continuing internecine strife between various factions, and accompanying lawlessness following the Soviet withdrawal, enabled the growing and well-disciplined Taliban to expand their control over territory in Afghanistan, and it came to establish an enclave which it called the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In 1994, it captured the regional center of Kandahar, and after making rapid territorial gains thereafter, conquered the capital city Kabul in September 1996.After the Sudanese made it clear, in May 1996, that bin Laden would never be welcome to return,  Taliban-controlled Afghanistan—with previously established connections between the groups, administered with a shared militancy,  and largely isolated from American political influence and military power—provided a perfect location for al-Qaeda to relocate its headquarters. Al-Qaeda enjoyed the Taliban\\'s protection and a measure of legitimacy as part of their Ministry of Defense, although only Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.While in Afghanistan, the Taliban government tasked al-Qaeda with the training of Brigade 055, an elite part of the Taliban\\'s army from 1997–2001. The Brigade was made up of mostly foreign fighters, many veterans from the Soviet Invasion, and all under the same basic ideology of the mujahideen. In November 2001, as Operation Enduring Freedom had toppled the Taliban government, many Brigade 055 fighters were captured or killed, and those that survived were thought to head into Pakistan along with bin Laden. By the end of 2008, some sources reported that the Taliban had severed any remaining ties with al-Qaeda,  while others cast doubt on this.  According to senior U.S. military intelligence officials, there were fewer than 100 members of al-Qaeda remaining in Afghanistan in 2009.  Call for global jihad  Around 1994, the Salafi groups waging jihad in Bosnia entered into a seemingly irreversible decline. As they grew less and less aggressive, groups such as EIJ began to drift away from the Salafi cause in Europe. Al-Qaeda decided to step in and assumed control of around 80% of the terrorist cells in Bosnia in late 1995.At the same time, al-Qaeda ideologues instructed the network\\'s recruiters to look for Jihadi international, Muslims who believed that jihad must be fought on a global level. The concept of a \"global Salafi jihad\" had been around since at least the early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land, at the same time, and with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy .Al-Qaeda sought to open the \"offensive phase\" of the global Salafi jihad.  Bosnian Islamists in 2006 called for \"solidarity with Islamic causes around the world\", supporting the insurgents in Kashmir and Iraq as well as the groups fighting for a Palestinian state.  Fatwas In 1996, al-Qaeda announced its jihad to expel foreign troops and interests from what they considered Islamic lands. Bin Laden issued a fatwa (binding religious edict),  which amounted to a public declaration of war against the U.S. and its allies, and began to refocus al-Qaeda\\'s resources on large-scale, propagandist strikes. In June 1996, the Khobar Towers bombing took place in Khobar, Saudi Arabia, attributed by some to al-Qaeda, killing 19 Americans and one Saudi local, and wounding 372. On February 23, 1998, bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, a leader of Egyptian Islamic Jihad, along with three other Islamist leaders, co-signed and issued a fatwa calling on Muslims to kill Americans and their allies where they can, when they can.  Under the banner of the World Islamic Front for Combat Against the Jews and Crusaders, they declared: [T]he ruling to kill the Americans and their allies—civilians and military—is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque [in Jerusalem] and the holy mosque [in Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, \\'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,\\' and \\'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah\\'.  Neither bin Laden nor al-Zawahiri possessed the traditional Islamic scholarly qualifications to issue a fatwa. However, they rejected the authority of the contemporary ulema (which they saw as the paid servants of jahiliyya rulers), and took it upon themselves.   Former Russian FSB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who was later killed, said that the FSB trained al-Zawahiri in a camp in Dagestan eight months before the 1998 fatwa.   Iraq  Al-Qaeda is Sunni, and often attacked the Iraqi Shia majority in an attempt to incite sectarian violence and greater chaos in the country.  Al-Zarqawi purportedly declared an all-out war on Shiites  while claiming responsibility for Shiite mosque bombings.  The same month, a statement claiming to be by AQI rejected as \"fake\" a letter allegedly written by al-Zawahiri, in which he appears to question the insurgents\\' tactic of indiscriminately attacking Shiites in Iraq.  In a December 2007 video, al-Zawahiri defended the Islamic State in Iraq, but distanced himself from the attacks against civilians committed by \"hypocrites and traitors existing among the ranks\". U.S. and Iraqi officials accused AQI of trying to slide Iraq into a full-scale civil war between Iraq\\'s majority Shiites and minority Sunni Arabs, with an orchestrated campaign of civilian massacres and a number of provocative attacks against high-profile religious targets. \"Al Qaeda leader in Iraq \\'killed by insurgents\\'\", ABC News, May 1, 2007  With attacks such as the 2003 Imam Ali Mosque bombing, the 2004 Day of Ashura and Karbala and Najaf bombings, the 2006 first al-Askari Mosque bombing in Samarra, the deadly single-day series of bombings in which at least 215 people were killed in Baghdad\\'s Shiite district of Sadr City, and the second al-Askari bombing in 2007, they provoked Shiite militias to unleash a wave of retaliatory attacks, resulting in death squad-style killings and spiraling further sectarian violence which escalated in 2006 and brought Iraq to the brink of violent anarchy in 2007. DeYoung, Karen/Pincus, Walter. \"Al-Qaeda in Iraq May Not Be Threat Here\", The Washington Post, March 18, 2007  In 2008, sectarian bombings blamed on al-Qaeda killed at least 42 people at the Imam Husayn Shrine in Karbala in March, and at least 51 people at a bus stop in Baghdad in June. Somalia and Yemen  In Somalia, al-Qaeda agents had been collaborating closely with its Somali wing, which was created from the al-Shabaab group. In February 2012, al-Shabaab officially joined al-Qaeda, declaring loyalty in a joint video.     The Somalian al-Qaeda actively recruit children for suicide-bomber training, and export young people to participate in military actions against Americans at the AfPak border. The percentage of terrorist attacks in the West originating from the Afghanistan-Pakistan (AfPak) border declined considerably from almost 100% to 75% in 2007, and to 50% in 2010, as al-Qaeda shifted to Somalia and Yemen.  While al-Qaeda leaders are hiding in the tribal areas along the AfPak border, the middle-tier of the movement display heightened activity in Somalia and Yemen. “We know that South Asia is no longer their primary base,” a U.S. defense agency source said. “They are looking for a hide-out in other parts of the world, and continue to expand their organization.“In January 2009, al-Qaeda’s division in Saudi Arabia merged with its Yemeni wing to form al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.  Centered in Yemen, the group takes advantage of the country\\'s poor economy, demography and domestic security. In August 2009, they made the first assassination attempt against a member of the Saudi royal dynasty in decades. President Obama asked his Yemen counterpart Ali Abdullah Saleh to ensure closer cooperation with the U.S. in the struggle against the growing activity of al-Qaeda in Yemen, and promised to send additional aid. Because of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the U.S. was unable to pay sufficient attention to Somalia and Yemen, which could cause problems in the near future.  In December 2011, U.S. Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta said that the U.S. operations against al-Qaeda \"are now concentrating on key groups in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa.\"    Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula claimed responsibility for the 2009 bombing attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 by Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab.  The group released photos of Abdulmutallab smiling in a white shirt and white Islamic skullcap, with the al-Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula banner in the background. American operations In December 1998, the Director of Central Intelligence Counterterrorist Center reported to the president that al-Qaeda was preparing for attacks in the USA, including the training of personnel to hijack aircraft.   On September 11, 2001, al-Qaeda attacked the United States, hijacking four airliners and deliberately crashing them.   The attackers killed 2,977 people.   U.S. officials called Anwar al-Awlaki an \"example of al-Qaeda reach into\" the U.S. in 2008 after probes into his ties to the September 11 attacks hijackers. A former FBI agent identifies Awlaki as a known \"senior recruiter for al-Qaeda\", and a spiritual motivator.  Awlaki\\'s sermons in the U.S. were attended by three of the 9/11 hijackers, as well as accused Fort Hood shooter Nidal Malik Hasan. U.S. intelligence intercepted emails from Hasan to Awlaki between December 2008 and early 2009. On his website, Awlaki has praised Hasan\\'s actions in the Fort Hood shooting. Esposito, Richard, Cole, Matthew, and Ross, Brian, \"Officials: U.S. Army Told of Hasan\\'s Contacts with al Qaeda; Army Major in Fort Hood Massacre Used \\'Electronic Means\\' to Connect with Terrorists,\" [[ABC News], November 9, 2009, accessed November 12, 2009] An unnamed official claimed there was good reason to believe Awlaki \"has been involved in very serious terrorist activities since leaving the U.S. [after 9/11], including plotting attacks against America and our allies.” WashingtonPost.com February 27, 2008 Imam From Va. Mosque Now Thought to Have Aided Al-Qaeda.  In addition, \"Christmas Day bomber\" Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab said al-Awlaki was one of his al-Qaeda trainers, meeting with him and involved in planning or preparing the attack, and provided religious justification for it, according to unnamed U.S. intelligence officials.          In March 2010, al Awlaki said in a videotape delivered to CNN that jihad against America was binding upon himself and every other able Muslim.       U.S. President Barack Obama approved the targeted killing of al-Awlaki by April 2010, making al-Awlaki the first U.S. citizen ever placed on the CIA target list. That required the consent of the U.S. National Security Council, and officials said it was appropriate for an individual who posed an imminent danger to national security.             In May 2010, Faisal Shahzad, who pleaded guilty to the 2010 Times Square car bombing attempt, told interrogators he was \"inspired by\" al-Awlaki, and sources said Shahzad had made contact with al-Awlaki over the internet.          Representative Jane Harman called him \"terrorist number one\", and Investor\\'s Business Daily called him \"the world\\'s most dangerous man\".   In July 2010, the U.S. Treasury Department added him to its list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists, and the UN added him to its list of individuals associated with al-Qaeda.    In August 2010, al-Awlaki\\'s father initiated a lawsuit against the U.S. government with the American Civil Liberties Union, challenging its order to kill al-Awlaki.    In October 2010, U.S. and U.K. officials linked al-Awlaki to the 2010 cargo plane bomb plot.     In September 2011, he was killed in a targeted killing drone attack in Yemen.  It was reported on March 16, 2012 that Osama bin Laden plotted to kill United States President Barack Obama.    Death of Osama bin Laden  On May 1, 2011 in Washington, D.C. (May 2, Pakistan Standard Time), U.S. President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden had been killed by \"a small team of Americans\" acting under Obama\\'s direct orders, in a covert operation in Abbottabad, Pakistan,     about   north of Islamabad.  According to U.S. officials a team of 20–25 US Navy SEALs under the command of the Joint Special Operations Command and working with the CIA stormed bin Laden\\'s compound in two helicopters. Bin Laden and those with him were killed during a firefight in which U.S. forces experienced no injuries or casualties.  According to one US official the attack was carried out without the knowledge or consent of the Pakistani authorities.    In Pakistan some people were reported to be shocked at the unauthorized incursion by US armed forces.  The site is a few miles from the Pakistan Military Academy in Kakul.  In his broadcast announcement President Obama said that U.S. forces \"took care to avoid civilian casualties.\"  Details soon emerged that three men and a woman were killed along with Bin Laden, the woman being killed when she was “used as a shield by a male combatant”.  DNA from bin Laden\\'s body, compared with DNA samples on record from his dead sister,  confirmed bin Laden\\'s identity.    The body was recovered by the US military and was in its custody    until, according to one US official, his body was buried at sea according to Islamic traditions.     One U.S. official stated that \"finding a country willing to accept the remains of the world\\'s most wanted terrorist would have been difficult.\"  U.S State Department issued a \"Worldwide caution\" for Americans following Bin Laden\\'s death and U.S Diplomatic facilities everywhere were placed on high alert, a senior U.S official said.    Crowds gathered outside the White House and in New York City\\'s Time Square to celebrate Bin Laden\\'s death.    Attacks  Al-Qaeda has carried out a total of six major terrorist attacks, four of them in its jihad against America. In each case the leadership planned the attack years in advance, arranging for the shipment of weapons and explosives and using its privatized businesses to provide operatives with safehouses and false identities.Al-Qaeda usually does not disburse funds for attacks, and very rarely makes wire transfers.  1992On December 29, 1992, al-Qaeda\\'s first terrorist attack took place as two bombs were detonated in Aden, Yemen. The first target was the Movenpick Hotel and the second was the parking lot of the Goldmohur Hotel.The bombings were an attempt to eliminate American soldiers on their way to Somalia to take part in the international famine relief effort, Operation Restore Hope. Internally, al-Qaeda considered the bombing a victory that frightened the Americans away, but in the U.S. the attack was barely noticed.No Americans were killed because the soldiers were staying in a different hotel altogether, and they went on to Somalia as scheduled. However little noticed, the attack was pivotal as it was the beginning of al-Qaeda\\'s change in direction, from fighting armies to killing civilians.  .  Two people were killed in the bombing, an Australian tourist and a Yemeni hotel worker. Seven others, mostly Yemenis, were severely injured.Two fatwas are said to have been appointed by the most theologically knowledgeable of al-Qaeda\\'s members, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, to justify the killings according to Islamic law. Salim referred to a famous fatwa appointed by Ibn Taymiyyah, a 13th-century scholar much admired by Wahhabis, which sanctioned resistance by any means during the Mongol invasions.   1993 World Trade Center bombing  In 1993, Ramzi Yousef used a truck bomb to attack the World Trade Center in New York City. The attack was intended to break the foundation of Tower One knocking it into Tower Two, bringing the entire complex down.Yousef hoped this would kill 250,000 people. The towers shook and swayed but the foundation held and he succeeded in killing only six people (although he injured 1,042 others and caused nearly $300\\xa0million in property damage).  ;  .     After the attack, Yousef fled to Pakistan and later moved to Manila. There he began developing the Bojinka Plot plans to implode a dozen American airliners simultaneously, to assassinate Pope John Paul II and President Bill Clinton, and to crash a private plane into CIA headquarters. He was later captured in Pakistan. None of the U.S. government\\'s indictments against bin Laden have suggested that he had any connection with this bombing, but Ramzi Yousef is known to have attended a terrorist training camp in Afghanistan. After his capture, Yousef declared that his primary justification for the attack was to punish the U.S. for its support for the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and made no mention of any religious motivations.  Late 1990s   In 1996, bin Laden personally engineered a plot to assassinate Clinton while the president was in Manila for the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation. However, intelligence agents intercepted a message just minutes before the motorcade was to leave, and alerted the U.S. Secret Service. Agents later discovered a bomb planted under a bridge. The 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in East Africa, resulting in upward of 300 deaths, mostly locals. A barrage of cruise missiles launched by the U.S. military in response devastated an al-Qaeda base in Khost, Afghanistan, but the network\\'s capacity was unharmed.In October 2000, al-Qaeda militants in Yemen bombed the missile destroyer U.S.S. Cole in a suicide attack, killing 17 U.S. servicemen and damaging the vessel while it lay offshore. Inspired by the success of such a brazen attack, al-Qaeda\\'s command core began to prepare for an attack on the U.S. itself. September 11 attacks    The September 11,  2001 attacks were the most devastating terrorist acts in American history, killing approximately 3,000 people. Two commercial airliners were deliberately flown into the World Trade Center towers, a third into The Pentagon, and a fourth, originally intended to target the United States Capitol, crashed in a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.The attacks were conducted by al-Qaeda, acting in accord with the 1998 fatwa issued against the U.S. and its allies by military forces under the command of bin Laden, al-Zawahiri, and others.  Evidence points to suicide squads led by al-Qaeda military commander Mohamed Atta as the culprits of the attacks, with bin Laden, Ayman al-Zawahiri, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and Hambali as the key planners and part of the political and military command.Messages issued by bin Laden after September 11, 2001 praised the attacks, and explained their motivation while denying any involvement.  Bin Laden legitimized the attacks by identifying grievances felt by both mainstream and Islamist Muslims, such as the general perception that the U.S. was actively oppressing Muslims. Bin Laden asserted that America was massacring Muslims in \\'Palestine, Chechnya, Kashmir and Iraq\\' and that Muslims should retain the \\'right to attack in reprisal\\'. He also claimed the 9/11 attacks were not targeted at women and children, but \\'America\\'s icons of military and economic power\\'. Evidence has since come to light that the original targets for the attack may have been nuclear power stations on the east coast of the U.S. The targets were later altered by al-Qaeda, as it was feared that such an attack \"might get out of hand\".       Designation as terrorist organizationAl-Qaeda has been designated a terrorist organization by the following countries and international organizations:   Australia    Canada    European Union    France    India  Ireland Israel    Japan    Netherlands    NATO     Philippines  Russia    South Korea    Sweden  Switzerland  Turkey    United Kingdom    United Nations Security Council    United States      War on Terrorism  In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, the U.S. government decided to respond militarily, and began to prepare its armed forces to overthrow the Taliban regime it believed was harboring al-Qaeda. Before the U.S. attacked, it offered Taliban leader Mullah Omar a chance to surrender bin Laden and his top associates. The first forces to be inserted into Afghanistan were Paramilitary Officers from the CIA\\'s elite Special Activities Division (SAD).The Taliban offered to turn over bin Laden to a neutral country for trial if the U.S. would provide evidence of bin Laden\\'s complicity in the attacks. U.S. President George W. Bush responded by saying: \"We know he\\'s guilty. Turn him over\",  and British Prime Minister Tony Blair warned the Taliban regime: \"Surrender bin Laden, or surrender power\". Soon thereafter the U.S. and its allies invaded Afghanistan, and together with the Afghan Northern Alliance removed the Taliban government in the war in Afghanistan.As a result of the U.S. using its special forces and providing air support for the Northern Alliance ground forces, both Taliban and al-Qaeda training camps were destroyed, and much of the operating structure of al-Qaeda is believed to have been disrupted. After being driven from their key positions in the Tora Bora area of Afghanistan, many al-Qaeda fighters tried to regroup in the rugged Gardez region of the nation. Again, under the cover of intense aerial bombardment, U.S. infantry and local Afghan forces attacked, shattering the al-Qaeda position and killing or capturing many of the militants. By early 2002, al-Qaeda had been dealt a serious blow to its operational capacity, and the Afghan invasion appeared an initial success. Nevertheless, a significant Taliban insurgency remains in Afghanistan, and al-Qaeda\\'s top two leaders, bin Laden and al-Zawahiri, evaded capture.Debate raged about the exact nature of al-Qaeda\\'s role in the 9/11 attacks, and after the U.S. invasion began, the U.S. State Department also released a videotape showing bin Laden speaking with a small group of associates somewhere in Afghanistan shortly before the Taliban was removed from power.  Although its authenticity has been questioned by some,  the tape appears to implicate bin Laden and al-Qaeda in the September 11 attacks and was aired on many television channels all over the world, with an accompanying English translation provided by the U.S. Defense Department.In September 2004, the US government 9/11 Commission investigating the September 11 attacks officially concluded that the attacks were conceived and implemented by al-Qaeda operatives.  In October 2004, bin Laden appeared to claim responsibility for the attacks in a videotape released through Al Jazeera, saying he was inspired by Israeli attacks on high-rises in the 1982 invasion of Lebanon: \"As I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children.\" By the end of 2004, the U.S. government proclaimed that two-thirds of the most senior al-Qaeda figures from 2001 had been captured and interrogated by the CIA: Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh and Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri in 2002;    Khalid Sheikh Mohammed in 2003; and Saif al Islam el Masry in 2004.  Mohammed Atef and several others were killed.   Activities Africa  Al-Qaeda involvement in Africa has included a number of bombing attacks in North Africa, as well as supporting parties in civil wars in Eritrea and Somalia. From 1991 to 1996, bin Laden and other al-Qaeda leaders were based in Sudan.Islamist rebels in the Sahara calling themselves al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb have stepped up their violence in recent years.         French officials say the rebels have no real links to the al-Qaeda leadership, but this is a matter of some dispute in the international press and amongst security analysts. It seems likely that bin Laden approved the group\\'s name in late 2006, and the rebels \"took on the al Qaeda franchise label\", almost a year before the violence began to escalate.  In Mali, the Ansar Dine faction was also reported as an ally of Al-Qaeda in 2013.  The Ansar al Dine faction aligned themselves with the AQIM.  Europe  In 2003, Islamists carried out a series of bombings in Istanbul killing fifty-seven people and injuring seven hundred. Seventy-four people were charged by the Turkish authorities. Some had previously met Bin Laden, and though they specifically declined to pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda they asked for its blessing and help.  In 2009, three Londoners, Tanvir Hussain, Assad Sarwar and Ahmed Abdullah Ali, were convicted of conspiring to detonate bombs disguised as soft drinks on seven airplanes bound for Canada and the U.S. The massively complex police and MI5 investigation of the plot involved more than a year of surveillance work conducted by over two hundred officers.        British and U.S. officials said the plan—unlike many recent homegrown European terrorist plots—was directly linked to al-Qaeda and guided by senior Islamic militants in Pakistan.   In 2012, Russian Intelligence indicated that al-Qaeda had given a call for \"forest jihad\" and has been starting massive forest fires as part of a strategy of \"thousand cuts\".  Arab world  Following Yemeni unification in 1990, Wahhabi networks began moving missionaries into the country in an effort to subvert the capitalist north. Although it is unlikely bin Laden or Saudi al-Qaeda were directly involved, the personal connections they made would be established over the next decade and used in the USS Cole bombing.  Concerns grow over Al Qaeda\\'s group in Yemen. In Iraq, al-Qaeda forces loosely associated with the leadership were embedded in the Jama\\'at al-Tawhid wal-Jihad organization commanded by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Specializing in suicide operations, they have been a \"key driver\" of the Sunni insurgency.  Although they played a small part in the overall insurgency, between 30% and 42% of all suicide bombings which took place in the early years were claimed by Zarqawi\\'s organization. See the following works cited in  :      Reports have indicated that oversights such as the failure to control access to the Qa\\'qaa munitions factory in Yusufiyah have allowed large quantities of munitions to fall into the hands of al-Qaida.  In November 2010, the Islamic State of Iraq militant group, which is linked to al-Qaeda in Iraq, threatened to \"exterminate Iraqi Christians\".   Significantly, it was not until the late 1990s that al-Qaeda began training Palestinians. This is not to suggest that resistance fighters are underrepresented in the network as a number of Palestinians, mostly coming from Jordan, wanted to join and have risen to serve high-profile roles in Afghanistan.  .  Rather, large groups such as Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad—which cooperate with al-Qaeda in many respects—have had difficulties accepting a strategic alliance, fearing that al-Qaeda will co-opt their smaller cells. This may have changed recently, as Israeli security and intelligence services believe al-Qaeda has managed to infiltrate operatives from the Occupied Territories into Israel, and is waiting for the right time to mount an attack.  Kashmir Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri consider India to be a part of the ‘Crusader-Zionist-Hindu’ conspiracy against the Islamic world.  According to the 2005 report \\'Al Qaeda: Profile and Threat Assessment\\' by Congressional Research Service, bin Laden was involved in training militants for Jihad in Kashmir while living in Sudan in the early nineties. By 2001 Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen had become a part of the al-Qaeda coalition.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees al-Qaeda was thought to have established bases in Pakistan-administered Kashmir (in Azad Kashmir, and to some extent in Gilgit–Baltistan) during the 1999 Kargil War and continued to operate there with tacit approval of Pakistan\\'s Intelligence services. Many of the militants active in Kashmir were trained in the same Madrasahs as Taliban and al-Qaeda. Fazlur Rehman Khalil of Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen was a signatory of al-Qaeda\\'s 1998 declaration of Jihad against America and its allies. Kashmir Militant Extremists, Council on Foreign Relations, July 9, 2009  In a \\'Letter to American People\\' written by bin Laden in 2002 he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of her support to India on the Kashmir issue.   In November 2001 Kathmandu airport went on high alert after threats that Bin Laden planned to hijack a plane from there and crash it into a target in New Delhi.  In 2002 U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, on a trip to Delhi, suggested that al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir though he did not have any hard evidence.  Rumsfeld offers US technology to guard Kashmir border, The Sydney Morning Herald, June 14, 2002  He proposed hi tech ground sensors along the line of control to prevent militants from infiltrating into Indian administered Kashmir.  An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan\\'s National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence  In 2002 a special team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian Administered Kashmir to hunt for Bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen which had previously been responsible for 1995 Kidnapping of western tourists in Kashmir.  Britain\\'s highest ranking al-Qaeda operative Rangzieb Ahmed had previously fought in Kashmir with the group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen and spent time in Indian prison after being captured in Kashmir. U.S. officials believe that al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan.  Their strategy was to force Pakistan to move its troops to the border with India, thereby relieving pressure on al-Qaeda elements hiding in northwestern Pakistan.  In 2006 al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this has worried the Indian government.   However the Indian Army Lt. Gen. H.S. Panag, GOC-in-C Northern Command, said to reporters that the army has ruled out the presence of al-Qaeda in Indian-administered Jammu and Kashmir; furthermore he said that there is nothing that can verify reports from the media of al-Qaeda presence in the state. He however stated that al-Qaeda had strong ties with Kashmiri militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed based in Pakistan.  It has been noted that Waziristan has now become the new battlefield for Kashmiri militants fighting NATO in support of al-Qaeda and Taliban.    Dhiren Barot, who wrote the Army of Madinah In Kashmir  and was an al-Qaeda operative convicted for involvement in the 2004 financial buildings plot, had received training in weapons and explosives at a militant training camp in Kashmir. Maulana Masood Azhar, the founder of another Kashmiri group Jaish-e-Mohammed, is believed to have met bin Laden several times and received funding from him.  In 2002 Jaish-e-Mohammed organized the kidnapping and murder of Daniel Pearl in an operation run in conjunction with al-Qaeda and funded by Bin Laden.  According to American counter-terrorism expert Bruce Riedel, al-Qaeda and Taliban were closely involved in the 1999 hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight 814 to Kandahar which led to the release of Maulana Masood Azhar & Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh from an Indian prison in exchange for the passengers. This hijacking, Riedel stated, was rightly described by then Indian Foreign minister Jaswant Singh as a \\'dress rehearsal\\' for September 11 attacks.  Bin laden personally welcomed Azhar and threw a lavish party in his honor after his release, according to Abu Jandal, bodyguard of Bin Laden.   Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, who had been in Indian prison for his role in 1994 kidnappings of Western tourists in India, went on to murder Daniel Pearl and was sentenced to death by Pakistan. Al-Qaeda operative Rashid Rauf, who was one of the accused in 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, was related to Maulana Masood Azhar by marriage. Lashkar-e-Taiba, a Kashmiri militant group which is thought to be behind 2008 Mumbai attacks, is also known to have strong ties to senior al-Qaeda leaders living in Pakistan.  In Late 2002 top al-Qaeda operative Abu Zubaydah was arrested while being sheltered by Lashkar-e-Taiba in a safe house in Faisalabad. Lashkar-e-Taiba Served as Gateway for Western Converts Turning to Jihad, The Wall Street Journal, December 4, 2008  The FBI believes that al-Qaeda and Lashkar have been \\'intertwined\\' for a long time while the CIA has said that al-Qaeda funds Lashkar-e-Taiba.  French investigating magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguière, who was the top French counter-terrorism official, told Reuters in 2009 that \\'Lashkar-e-Taiba is no longer a Pakistani movement with only a Kashmir political or military agenda. Lashkar-e-Taiba is a member of al-Qaeda.\\'  In a video released in 2008, senior al-Qaeda operative American-born Adam Yahiye Gadahn stated that \"victory in Kashmir has been delayed for years; it is the liberation of the jihad there from this interference which, Allah willing, will be the first step towards victory over the Hindu occupiers of that Islam land.\" In September 2009 a U.S. Drone strike reportedly killed Ilyas Kashmiri who was the chief of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, a Kashmiri militant group associated with al-Qaeda.  Kashmiri was described by Bruce Riedel as a \\'prominent\\' al-Qaeda member  while others have described him as head of military operations for al-Qaeda.   Kashmiri was also charged by the U.S. in a plot against Jyllands-Posten, the Danish newspaper which was at the center of Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy.  U.S. officials also believe that Kashmiri was involved in the Camp Chapman attack against the CIA.  In January 2010 Indian authorities notified Britain of an al-Qaeda plot to hijack an Indian airlines or Air India plane and crash it into a British city. This information was uncovered from interrogation of Amjad Khwaja, an operative of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami, who had been arrested in India. In January 2010 U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates, while on a visit to Pakistan, stated that al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.  InternetTimothy L. Thomas claims that in the wake of its evacuation from Afghanistan, al-Qaeda and its successors have migrated online to escape detection in an atmosphere of increased international vigilance. As a result, the organization\\'s use of the Internet has grown more sophisticated, encompassing financing, recruitment, networking, mobilization, publicity, as well as information dissemination, gathering and sharing.  Abu Ayyub al-Masri’s al-Qaeda movement in Iraq regularly releases short videos glorifying the activity of jihadist suicide bombers. In addition, both before and after the death of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi (the former leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq), the umbrella organization to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, the Mujahideen Shura Council, has a regular presence on the Web. The range of multimedia content includes guerrilla training clips, stills of victims about to be murdered, testimonials of suicide bombers, and videos that show participation in jihad through stylized portraits of mosques and musical scores. A website associated with al-Qaeda posted a video of captured American entrepreneur Nick Berg being decapitated in Iraq. Other decapitation videos and pictures, including those of Paul Johnson, Kim Sun-il, and Daniel Pearl, were first posted on jihadist websites.In December 2004 an audio message claiming to be from Bin Laden was posted directly to a website, rather than sending a copy to al Jazeera as he had done in the past.Al-Qaeda turned to the Internet for release of its videos in order to be certain it would be available unedited, rather than risk the possibility of al Jazeera editors editing the videos and cutting out anything critical of the Saudi royal family.  Bin Laden\\'s December 2004 message was much more vehement than usual in this speech, lasting over an hour.In the past, Alneda.com and Jehad.net were perhaps the most significant al-Qaeda websites. Alneda was initially taken down by American Jon Messner, but the operators resisted by shifting the site to various servers and strategically shifting content.The U.S. is currently attempting to extradite a British information technology specialist, Babar Ahmad, on charges of operating a network of English-language al-Qaeda websites, such as Azzam.com.   Ahmad\\'s extradition is opposed by various British Muslim organizations, such as the Muslim Association of Britain. Aviation networkAl-Qaeda is believed to be operating a clandestine aviation network including “several Boeing 727 aircraft”, turboprops and executive jets, according to a Reuters story. Based on a U.S. Department of Homeland Security report, the story said that al-Qaeda is possibly using aircraft to transport drugs and weapons from South America to various unstable countries in West Africa. A Boeing 727 can carry up to 10 tons of cargo. The drugs eventually are smuggled to Europe for distribution and sale, and the weapons are used in conflicts in Africa and possibly elsewhere. Gunmen with links to al-Qaeda have been increasingly kidnapping some Europeans for ransom. The profits from the drug and weapon sales, and kidnappings can, in turn, fund more militant activities.  Alleged CIA involvement  Experts debate whether or not the al-Qaeda attacks were blowback from the American CIA\\'s \"Operation Cyclone\" program to help the Afghan mujahideen. Robin Cook, British Foreign Secretary from 1997 to 2001, has written that al-Qaeda and Bin Laden were \"a product of a monumental miscalculation by western security agencies\", and that \"Al-Qaida, literally \\'the database\\', was originally the computer file of the thousands of mujahideen who were recruited and trained with help from the CIA to defeat the Russians.\"  Munir Akram, Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations from 2002 to 2008, wrote in a letter published in the New York Times on January 19, 2008:  The strategy to support the Afghans against Soviet military intervention was evolved by several intelligence agencies, including the C.I.A. and Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. After the Soviet withdrawal, the Western powers walked away from the region, leaving behind 40,000 militants imported from several countries to wage the anti-Soviet jihad. Pakistan was left to face the blowback of extremism, drugs and guns.  A variety of sources—CNN journalist Peter Bergen, Pakistani ISI Brigadier Mohammad Yousaf, and CIA operatives involved in the Afghan program, such as Vincent Cannistraro—deny that the CIA or other American officials had contact with the foreign mujahideen or Bin Laden, let alone armed, trained, coached or indoctrinated them.Bergen and others argue that there was no need to recruit foreigners unfamiliar with the local language, customs or lay of the land since there were a quarter of a million local Afghans willing to fight;  that foreign mujahideen themselves had no need for American funds since they received several hundred million dollars a year from non-American, Muslim sources; that Americans could not have trained mujahideen because Pakistani officials would not allow more than a handful of them to operate in Pakistan and none in Afghanistan; and that the Afghan Arabs were almost invariably militant Islamists reflexively hostile to Westerners whether or not the Westerners were helping the Muslim Afghans.According to Bergen, known for conducting the first television interview with bin Laden in 1997, the idea that \"the CIA funded bin Laden or trained bin Laden ...[is] a folk myth. There\\'s no evidence of this. ... Bin Laden had his own money, he was anti-American and he was operating secretly and independently. ... The real story here is the CIA didn\\'t really have a clue about who this guy was until 1996 when they set up a unit to really start tracking him.\"  But Bergen conceded that, in one \"strange incident,\" the CIA appeared to give visa help to mujahideen-recruiter Omar Abdel-Rahman. In his widely praised account of al-Qaeda, English journalist Jason Burke wrote:  Broader influenceAnders Breivik was inspired by al-Qaeda, calling it \"the most successful revolutionary movement in the world.\" While admitting different aims, he sought to \"create a European version of al-Qaida.\"   CriticismAccording to a number of sources there has been a \"wave of revulsion\" against al-Qaeda and its affiliates by \"religious scholars, former fighters and militants\" alarmed by al-Qaeda\\'s takfir and killing of Muslims in Muslim countries, especially Iraq. Noman Benotman, a former Afghan Arab and militant of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, went public with an open letter of criticism to Ayman al-Zawahiri in November 2007 after persuading imprisoned senior leadership of his former group to enter into peace negotiations with the Libyan regime. While Ayman al-Zawahiri announced the affiliation of the group with al-Qaeda in November 2007, the Libyan government released 90 members of the group from prison several months later after \"they were said to have renounced violence.\" In 2007, around the sixth anniversary of the September 11 attacks and a couple of months before Rationalizing Jihad first appeared in the newspapers,  the Saudi sheikh Salman al-Ouda delivered a personal rebuke to bin Laden. Al-Ouda, a religious scholar and one of the fathers of the Sahwa, the fundamentalist awakening movement that swept through Saudi Arabia in the 1980s, is a widely respected critic of jihadism.  Al-Ouda addressed al-Qaeda\\'s leader on television asking him  My brother Osama, how much blood has been spilt? How many innocent people, children, elderly, and women have been killed ... in the name of al-Qaeda? Will you be happy to meet God Almighty carrying the burden of these hundreds of thousands or millions [of victims] on your back?  .  According to Pew polls, support for al-Qaeda has been slightly dropped for parts of the Muslim world in the years before 2008.  The numbers supporting suicide bombings in Indonesia, Lebanon, and Bangladesh, for instance, have dropped by half or more in the last five years. In Saudi Arabia, only 10\\xa0percent now have a favorable view of al-Qaeda, according to a December poll by Terror Free Tomorrow, a Washington-based think tank. In 2007, the imprisoned Sayyed Imam Al-Sharif, an influential Afghan Arab, \"ideological godfather of al-Qaeda\", and former supporter of takfir, sensationally withdrew his support from al-Qaeda with a book Wathiqat Tarshid Al-\\'Aml Al-Jihadi fi Misr w\\'Al-\\'Alam (Rationalizing Jihad in Egypt and the World).Although once associated with al-Qaeda, in September 2009 LIFG completed a new \"code\" for jihad, a 417-page religious document entitled \"Corrective Studies\". Given its credibility and the fact that several other prominent Jihadists in the Middle East have turned against al-Qaeda, the LIFG\\'s about face may be an important step toward staunching al-Qaeda\\'s recruitment.

Investigating Al-Qaeda, BBC News   Al Qaeda\\'s New Front from PBS Frontline, January 2005 Inside al Qaeda – video report by National Geographic',5285: 'STS-51-F    STS-51-F (also known as Spacelab 2) was the nineteenth flight of NASA\\'s Space Shuttle program, and the eighth flight of Space Shuttle Challenger. It launched from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, on 29 July 1985, and landed just under eight days later on 6 August.While STS-51-F\\'s primary payload was the Spacelab 2 laboratory module, the payload which received the most publicity was the Carbonated Beverage Dispenser Evaluation, which was an experiment in which both Coca-Cola and Pepsi tried to make their carbonated drinks available to astronauts.  Crew  Backup crew  Mission parameters Mass: Orbiter Liftoff:    Orbiter Landing:    Payload:    Perigee:   Apogee:   Inclination: 49.5° Period: 90.9 min LaunchSTS-51-F\\'s first launch attempt on 12 July 1985 was halted with the countdown at T-3 seconds after main engine ignition, when a malfunction of the number two Space Shuttle Main Engine (SSME) coolant valve caused the shutdown of all three main engines. Challenger launched successfully on its second attempt at 29 July 1985, 17:00 EDT, after a delay of one hour and 37 minutes due to a problem with the table maintenance block update uplink. Three minutes and 31 seconds into the ascent, one of the center engine\\'s two high pressure fuel turbopump turbine discharge temperature sensors failed. Two minutes and 12 seconds later, the second sensor failed, causing the shutdown of the center engine. This was the only in-flight main engine failure of the shuttle program. Approximately 8 minutes into the flight, one of the same temperature sensors in the right engine failed, and the remaining right engine temperature sensor displayed readings near the redline for engine shutdown. Booster Systems Engineer Jenny M. Howard acted quickly to command the crew to inhibit any further automatic SSME shutdowns based on readings from the remaining sensors, preventing the potential shutdown of a second engine and a possible abort mode that may have resulted in the loss of the vehicle and crew.   The failed SSME resulted in an Abort to Orbit (ATO) trajectory, whereby the shuttle achieved a lower-than-planned orbital altitude. Mission summary STS-51-F\\'s primary payload was the laboratory module Spacelab 2. A special part of the modular Spacelab system, the \"igloo\", which was located at head of a three-pallet train, provided on-site support to instruments mounted on pallets. The main mission objective was to verify performance of Spacelab systems, determine the interface capability of the orbiter, and measure the environment created by the spacecraft. Experiments covered life sciences, plasma physics, astronomy, high-energy astrophysics, solar physics, atmospheric physics and technology research. Despite mission replanning necessitated by Challenger \\' s abort to orbit trajectory, the Spacelab mission was declared a success.The flight marked the first time the ESA Instrument Pointing System (IPS) was tested in orbit. This unique pointing instrument was designed with an accuracy of one arcsecond. Initially, some problems were experienced when it was commanded to track the Sun, but a series of software fixes were made and the problem was corrected. In addition, Tony England became the second amateur radio operator to transmit from space during the mission.The Spacelab Infrared Telescope (IRT) was also flown on the mission.  The IRT was a 15.2\\xa0cm aperture helium-cooled infrared telescope, observing light between wavelengths of 1.7 to 118 μm. Kent, et al. – Galactic structure from the Spacelab infrared telescope (1992).  The experiment experienced some problems, such as heat emissions from the Shuttle corrupting data, but still returned useful astronomical data. In a heavily-publicised marketing experiment, astronauts aboard STS-51-F enjoyed carbonated beverages from specially-designed cans provided by competitors Coca-Cola and Pepsi.  Post-flight, the astronauts revealed that they preferred the traditional astronaut\\'s drink Tang, in part because it could be mixed on-orbit with existing chilled water supplies, whereas there was no dedicated refrigeration equipment on board to chill the soda, which also fizzed excessively in microgravity. LandingChallenger landed at Edwards Air Force Base, California, on 6 August 1985, at 12:45:26\\xa0pm PDT. Its rollout distance was  . The mission had been extended by 17 orbits for additional payload activities due to the Abort to Orbit. The orbiter arrived back at Kennedy Space Center on 11 August 1985. Mission insigniaThe mission insignia was designed by Houston artist Skip Bradley. Space Shuttle Challenger is depicted ascending toward the heavens in search of new knowledge in the field of solar and stellar astronomy, with its Spacelab 2 payload.

It was also known as the House of Anhalt, after Anhalt, its longest-held possession.The Ascanians are named after Ascania (or Ascaria) Castle, Schloss Askanien, which is located near and named after Aschersleben. The castle was seat of the County of Ascania, a title that was later subsumed into the titles of the princes of Anhalt. History The earliest known member of the house, Esiko, Count of Ballenstedt, first appears in a document of 1036, and is assumed to have been a grandson (through his mother) of Odo I, Margrave of the Saxon Ostmark. From Odo, the Ascanians inherited large properties in the Saxon Eastern March.Esiko's grandson was Otto, Count of Ballenstedt, who died in 1123.  By Otto's marriage to Eilika, daughter of Magnus, Duke of Saxony, the Ascanians became heirs to half of the property of the House of Billung, former dukes of Saxony. Otto's son, Albert the Bear, became, with the help of his mother's inheritance, the first Ascanian duke of Saxony in 1139. But he lost control of Saxony soon to the rival House of Guelph.However, Albert inherited the Margraviate of Brandenburg from its last Wendish ruler, Pribislav, in 1157, and became the first Ascanian margrave. Albert, and his descendants of the House of Ascania, then made considerable progress in Christianizing and Germanizing the lands. As a borderland between German and Slavic cultures, the country was known as a march. In 1237 and 1244 two towns, Cölln and Berlin were founded during the rule of Otto and Johann, grandsons of Margrave Albert the Bear, (later they were united into one city, Berlin). The emblem of the House of Ascania, red eagle and bear, became the heraldic emblems of Berlin.In 1320 the Brandenburg Ascanian line came to an end.After the Emperor had deposed the Guelph rulers of Saxony in 1180, Ascanians returned to rule the Duchy of Saxony, which had been reduced to its eastern half by the Emperor. However, even in eastern Saxony, the Ascanians could establish control only in limited areas, mostly near the River Elbe. In the 13th century, the Principality of Anhalt was split off from the Duchy, and later, the remaining state was split into Saxe-Lauenburg and Saxe-Wittenberg. The Ascanian dynasties in the two Saxon states became extinct in 1689 and in 1422, respectively, but Ascanians continued to rule in the smaller state of Anhalt and its various subdivisions until monarchy was abolished in 1918. Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia from 1762–1796, was a member of the House of Ascania, herself the daughter of Christian August, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst.

An array is stored so that the position of each element can be computed from its index tuple by a mathematical formula.       For example, an array of 10 integer variables, with indices 0 through 9, may be stored as 10 words at memory addresses 2000, 2004, 2008, … 2036, so that the element with index i has the address 2000 + 4 × i. Because the mathematical concept of a matrix can be represented as a two-dimensional grid, two-dimensional arrays are also sometimes called matrices. In some cases the term \"vector\" is used in computing to refer to an array, although tuples rather than vectors are more correctly the mathematical equivalent. Arrays are often used to implement tables, especially lookup tables; the word table is sometimes used as a synonym of array.Arrays are among the oldest and most important data structures, and are used by almost every program. They are also used to implement many other data structures, such as lists and strings.  They effectively exploit the addressing logic of computers. In most modern computers and many external storage devices, the memory is a one-dimensional array of words, whose indices are their addresses.  Processors, especially vector processors, are often optimized for array operations.Arrays are useful mostly because the element indices can be computed at run time.  Among other things, this feature allows a single iterative statement to process arbitrarily many elements of an array.  For that reason, the elements of an array data structure are required to have the same size and should use the same data representation. The set of valid index tuples and the addresses of the elements (and hence the element addressing formula) are usually,  T. Veldhuizen. Arrays in Blitz++. In Proc. of the 2nd Int. Conf. on Scientific Computing in Object-Oriented Parallel Environments (ISCOPE), LNCS 1505, pages 223-220. Springer, 1998.  but not always,  fixed while the array is in use.The term array is often used to mean array data type, a kind of data type provided by most high-level programming languages that consists of a collection of values or variables that can be selected by one or more indices computed at run-time.  Array types are often implemented by array structures; however, in some languages they may be implemented by hash tables, linked lists, search trees, or other data structures.The term is also used, especially in the description of algorithms, to mean associative array or \"abstract array\", a theoretical computer science model (an abstract data type or ADT) intended to capture the essential properties of arrays. HistoryThe first digital computers used machine-language programming to set up and access array structures for data tables, vector and matrix computations, and for many other purposes. Von Neumann wrote the first array-sorting program (merge sort) in 1945, during the building of the first stored-program computer.  p.\\xa0159   Array indexing was originally done by self-modifying code, and later using index registers and indirect addressing.  Some mainframes designed in the 1960s, such as the Burroughs B5000 and its successors, had special instructions for array indexing that included index-bounds checking. .Assembly languages generally have no special support for arrays, other than what the machine itself provides. The earliest high-level programming languages, including FORTRAN (1957), COBOL (1960), and ALGOL 60 (1960), had support for multi-dimensional arrays, and so has C (1972). In C++ (1983), class templates exist for multi-dimensional arrays whose dimension is fixed at runtime   as well as for runtime-flexible arrays.   ApplicationsArrays are used to implement mathematical vectors and matrices, as well as other kinds of rectangular tables.  Many databases, small and large, consist of (or include) one-dimensional arrays whose elements are records.Arrays are used to implement other data structures, such as heaps, hash tables, deques, queues, stacks, strings, and VLists.One or more large arrays are sometimes used to emulate in-program dynamic memory allocation, particularly memory pool allocation. Historically, this has sometimes been the only way to allocate \"dynamic memory\" portably.Arrays can be used to determine partial or complete control flow in programs, as a compact alternative to (otherwise repetitive), multiple  IF  statements. They are known in this context as control tables and are used in conjunction with a purpose built interpreter whose control flow is altered according to values contained in the array. The array may contain subroutine pointers (or relative subroutine numbers that can be acted upon by SWITCH statements) - that direct the path of the execution. Array element identifier and addressing formulas When data objects are stored in an array, individual objects are selected by an index that is usually a non-negative scalar integer. Indices are also called subscripts.  An index maps the array value to a stored object.There are three ways in which the elements of an array can be indexed: 0 (zero-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 0.  1 (one-based indexing): The first element of the array is indexed by subscript of 1.  n (n-based indexing): The base index of an array can be freely chosen. Usually programming languages allowing n-based indexing also allow negative index values and other scalar data types like enumerations, or characters may be used as an array index. Arrays can have multiple dimensions, thus it is not uncommon to access an array using multiple indices. For example a two-dimensional array   A  with three rows and four columns might provide access to the element at the 2nd row and 4th column by the expression:  A[1, 3]  (in a row major language) and  A[3, 1]  (in a column major language) in the case of a zero-based indexing system. Thus two indices are used for a two-dimensional array, three for a three-dimensional array, and n for an n-dimensional array.The number of indices needed to specify an element is called the dimension, dimensionality, or rank of the array.In standard arrays, each index is restricted to a certain range of consecutive integers (or consecutive values of some enumerated type), and the address of an element is computed by a \"linear\" formula on the indices. One-dimensional arraysA one-dimensional array (or single dimension array) is a type of linear array. Accessing its elements involves a single subscript which can either represent a row or column index.As an example consider the C declaration  int anArrayName[10]; Syntax : datatype anArrayname[sizeofArray];In the given example the array can contain 10 elements of any value available to the  int  type.  In C, the array element indices are 0-9 inclusive in this case.  For example, the expressions  anArrayName[0] , and  anArrayName[9]  are the first and last elements respectively.For a vector with linear addressing, the element with index i is located at the address B + c · i, where B is a fixed base address and c a fixed constant, sometimes called the  address increment or stride.If the valid element indices begin at 0, the constant B is simply the address of the first element of the array. For this reason, the C programming language specifies that array indices always begin at 0; and many programmers will call that element \"zeroth\" rather than \"first\".However, one can choose the index of the first element by an appropriate choice of the base address B.  For example, if the array has five elements, indexed 1 through 5, and the base address B is replaced by B + 30c, then the indices of those same elements will be 31 to 35.  If the numbering does not start at 0, the constant B may not be the address of any element. Multidimensional arraysFor a two-dimensional array, the element with indices i,j would have address B + c · i + d · j, where the coefficients c and d are the row and column address increments, respectively.More generally, in a k-dimensional array, the address of an element with indices i 1 , i 2 , …, i k  is B + c 1  · i 1  + c 2  · i 2  + … + c k  · i k . For example: int a[3][2];This means that array a has 3 rows and 2 columns, and the array is of integer type. Here we can store 6 elements they are stored linearly but starting from first row linear then continuing with second row. The above array will be stored as a 11 , a 12 , a 13 , a 21 , a 22 , a 23 .This formula requires only k multiplications and k−1 additions, for any array that can fit in memory. Moreover, if any coefficient is a fixed power of 2, the multiplication can be replaced by bit shifting.The coefficients c k  must be chosen so that every valid index tuple maps to the address of a distinct element.If the minimum legal value for every index is 0, then B is the address of the element whose indices are all zero.  As in the one-dimensional case, the element indices may be changed by changing the base address B.  Thus, if a two-dimensional array has rows and columns indexed from 1 to 10 and 1 to 20, respectively, then replacing  B by B + c 1  - − 3 c 1  will cause them to be renumbered from 0 through 9 and 4 through 23, respectively.  Taking advantage of this feature, some languages (like FORTRAN 77) specify that array indices begin at 1, as in mathematical tradition; while other languages (like Fortran 90, Pascal and Algol) let the user choose the minimum value for each index. Dope vectorsThe addressing formula is completely defined by the dimension d, the base address B, and the increments c 1 , c 2 , …, c k .  It is often  useful to pack these parameters into a record called the array\\'s descriptor or stride vector or dope vector.    The size of each element, and the minimum and maximum values allowed for each index may also be included in the dope vector.  The dope vector is a complete handle for the array, and is a convenient way to pass arrays as arguments to procedures.  Many useful array slicing operations (such as selecting a sub-array, swapping indices, or reversing the direction of the indices) can be performed very efficiently by manipulating the dope vector.  Compact layoutsOften the coefficients are chosen so that the elements occupy a contiguous area of memory.  However, that is not necessary.  Even if arrays are always created with contiguous elements, some array slicing operations may create non-contiguous sub-arrays from them.There are two systematic compact layouts for a two-dimensional array.  For example, consider the matrix  \\\\mathbf{A} = \\\\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\\\\ 7 & 8 & 9 \\\\end{bmatrix}.   In the row-major order layout (adopted by C for statically declared arrays), the elements in each row are stored in consecutive positions and all of the elements of a row have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive row: 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 In column-major order (traditionally used by Fortran), the elements in each column are consecutive in memory and all of the elements of a columns have a lower address than any of the elements of a consecutive column: 1  4  7  2  5  8  3  6  9 For arrays with three or more indices, \"row major order\" puts in consecutive positions any two elements whose index tuples differ only by one in the last index.  \"Column major order\" is analogous with respect to the first index.In systems which use processor cache or virtual memory, scanning an array is much faster if successive elements are stored in consecutive positions in memory, rather than sparsely scattered.  Many algorithms that use multidimensional arrays will scan them in a predictable order. A programmer (or a sophisticated compiler) may use this information to choose between row- or column-major layout for each array.  For example,  when computing the product A·B of two matrices, it would be best to have A stored in row-major order, and  B in column-major order. Array resizing Static arrays have a size that is fixed when they are created and consequently do not allow elements to be inserted or removed. However, by allocating a new array and copying the contents of the old array to it, it is possible to effectively implement a dynamic version of an array; see dynamic array. If this operation is done infrequently, insertions at the end of the array require only amortized constant time.Some array data structures do not reallocate storage, but do store a count of the number of elements of the array in use, called the count or size. This effectively makes the array a dynamic array with a fixed maximum size or capacity; Pascal strings are examples of this. Non-linear formulasMore complicated (non-linear) formulas are occasionally used. For a compact two-dimensional triangular array, for instance, the addressing formula is a polynomial of degree 2. EfficiencyBoth store and select take (deterministic worst case) constant time. Arrays take linear (O(n)) space in the number of elements n that they hold.In an array with element size k and on a machine with a cache line size of B bytes, iterating through an array of n elements requires the minimum of ceiling(nk/B) cache misses, because its elements occupy contiguous memory locations. This is roughly a factor of B/k better than the number of cache misses needed to access n elements at random memory locations. As a consequence, sequential iteration over an array is noticeably faster in practice than iteration over many other data structures, a property called locality of reference (this does not mean however, that using a perfect hash or trivial hash within the same (local) array, will not be even faster - and achievable in constant time). Libraries provide low-level optimized facilities for copying ranges of memory (such as memcpy) which can be used to move contiguous blocks of array elements significantly faster than can be achieved through individual element access. The speedup of such optimized routines varies by array element size, architecture, and implementation.Memory-wise, arrays are compact data structures with no per-element overhead. There may be a per-array overhead, e.g. to store index bounds, but this is language-dependent. It can also happen that elements stored in an array require less memory than the same elements stored in individual variables, because several array elements can be stored in a single word; such arrays are often called packed arrays. An extreme (but commonly used) case is the bit array, where every bit represents a single element. A single octet can thus hold up to 256 different combinations of up to 8 different conditions, in the most compact form.Array accesses with statically predictable access patterns are a major source of data parallelism. Efficiency comparison with other data structures  Growable arrays are similar to arrays but add the ability to insert and delete elements; adding and deleting at the end is particularly efficient. However, they reserve linear (Θ(n)) additional storage, whereas arrays do not reserve additional storage.Associative arrays provide a mechanism for array-like functionality without huge storage overheads when the index values are sparse. For example, an array that contains values only at indexes 1 and 2 billion may benefit from using such a structure. Specialized associative arrays with integer keys include Patricia tries, Judy arrays, and van Emde Boas trees.Balanced trees require O(log n) time for indexed access, but also permit inserting or deleting elements in O(log n) time,  whereas growable arrays require linear (Θ(n)) time to insert or delete elements at an arbitrary position.Linked lists allow constant time removal and insertion in the middle but take linear time for indexed access. Their memory use is typically worse than arrays, but is still linear. An Iliffe vector is an alternative to a multidimensional array structure. It uses a one-dimensional array of references to arrays of one dimension less. For two dimensions, in particular, this alternative structure would be a vector of pointers to vectors, one for each row.  Thus an element in row i and column j of an array A would be accessed by double indexing (A[i][j] in typical notation).  This alternative structure allows ragged or jagged arrays, where each row may have a different size — or, in general, where the valid range of each index depends on the values of all preceding indices.  It also saves one multiplication (by the column address increment) replacing it by a bit shift (to index the vector of row pointers) and one extra memory access (fetching the row address), which may be worthwhile in some architectures.  Meaning of dimensionThe dimension of an array is the number of indices needed to select an element. Thus, if the array is seen as a function on a set of possible index combinations, it is the dimension of the space of which its domain is a discrete subset. Thus a one-dimensional array is a list of data, a two-dimensional array a rectangle of data, a three-dimensional array a block of data, etc.This should not be confused with the dimension of the set of all matrices with a given domain, that is, the number of elements in the array. For example, an array with 5 rows and 4 columns is two-dimensional, but such matrices form a 20-dimensional space. Similarly, a three-dimensional vector can be represented by a one-dimensional array of size three.

Bishkek is also the administrative centre of Chuy Province which surrounds the city, even though the city itself is not part of the province but rather a province-level unit of Kyrgyzstan.The name is thought to derive from a Kyrgyz word for a churn used to make fermented mare\\'s milk (kumis), the Kyrgyz national drink. Founded in 1825 as the Kyrgyz-Khokand fortress of \"Bishkek\", then, in 1862, named as the Russian fortress Pishpek (крепость Пишпек),  in 1926 the city was renamed Frunze (Фрунзе), after the Bolshevik military leader Mikhail Frunze. In 1991, the Kyrgyz parliament restored the city\\'s historical name.Bishkek is situated at about   altitude just off the northern fringe of the Kyrgyz Ala-Too range, an extension of the Tian Shan mountain range, which rises up to   and provides a spectacular backdrop to the city. North of the city, a fertile and gently undulating steppe extends far north into neighboring Kazakhstan. The Chui River drains most of the area. Bishkek is connected to the Turkestan-Siberia Railway by a spur line.Bishkek is a city of wide boulevards and marble-faced public buildings combined with numerous Soviet-style apartment blocks surrounding interior courtyards and, especially outside the city centre, thousands of smaller privately built houses. It is laid out on a grid pattern, with most streets flanked on both sides by narrow irrigation channels that water the innumerable trees which provide shade in the hot summers. HistoryOriginally a caravan rest stop (possibly founded by the Sogdians) on one of the branches of the Silk Road through the Tian Shan range, the location was fortified in 1825 by the Uzbek khan of Kokhand with a mud fort.In 1862, the fort was conquered and razed when Tsarist Russia annexed the area. The Russians rebuilt the town over the destroyed fort. The site became a Russian garrison and was redeveloped and named \"Pishpek\" from 1877 onward by the Russian government, which encouraged the settlement of Russian peasants by giving them fertile black soil farms to develop. In 1926, the city became the capital of the newly established Kirghiz ASSR and was renamed \"Frunze\" after Mikhail Frunze, Lenin\\'s close associate who was born in Bishkek and played key roles during the 1905 and 1917 revolutions and during the Russian civil war of the early 1920s.The early 1990s were tumultuous. In June 1990, a state of emergency was declared following severe riots in southern Kyrgyzstan which threatened to spread to the capital. The city was renamed Bishkek on 5 February 1991 and Kyrgyzstan achieved independence later that year during the breakup of the Soviet Union. Before independence, Bishkek was a \"Russified\" city, the majority of its population being ethnic Russians. In 2004, Russians made up approximately 20% of the city\\'s population (only about 7–8% in 2011).   Today, Bishkek is a modernizing city, with many restaurants and cafes and lots of second-hand European and Japanese cars and minibuses crowding its streets. But streets and sidewalks have fallen into disrepair since the Russians started rapidly leaving in the 90s. At the same time Bishkek still preserves its former Soviet feel, with Soviet-period buildings and gardens prevailing over newer structures.Bishkek is also the country\\'s financial centre, with all of the country\\'s 21 commercial banks featuring offices in the city. During the Soviet era, the city was home to a large number of industrial plants, but most have been shut down after 1991 or operate today on a much reduced scale. One of  Bishkek\\'s largest employment centres today is Dordoy Bazaar, which is one of the major entrepôts for Chinese goods imported into CIS countries. Geography OrientationThough the city is relatively young, the surrounding area has some sites of interest dating from prehistory, the Greco-Buddhist period, the period of Nestorian influence, the era of the Central Asian khanates, and the Soviet period. The central part of the city is primarily built on a rectangular grid plan. The city\\'s main street is the east-west Chui Avenue (Chuy Prospekti), named after the region\\'s main river. In the Soviet era, it was called Lenin Avenue. Along, or within a block or two from it, many of the most important government buildings, universities, the Academy of Sciences compound, and so on, are to be found. The westernmost section of the avenue is known as Deng Xiaoping Avenue.The main north-south axis is Yusup Abdrakhmanov Street, still (2007) commonly referred to by its old name, Sovietskaya Street. Its northern and southern sections are called, respectively, Yelebesov and Baityk Batyr Streets. Several major shopping centres are located along it, and in the north it provides access to Dordoy Bazaar.Erkindik (\"Freedom\") Boulevard runs north-south, from the main railroad station (Bishkek II) south of Chui Avenue to the museum quarter and sculpture park just north of Chui Avenue, and further north toward the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In the past, it was called Dzerzhinsky Boulevard—named after Communist revolutionary, Felix Dzerzhinsky—and its northern continuation is still called Dzerzhinsky Street.An important east-west street is Jibek Jolu (\\'Silk Road\\'). It runs parallel to Chui Avenue about a mile north of it, and is part of the main east-west road of Chui Province. Both the Eastern and Western bus terminals are located along Jibek Jolu.There is a Roman Catholic church located at ul. Vasiljeva 197 (near Rynok Bayat). This is the only Catholic Cathedral in Kyrgyzstan.  City centre State Historical Museum, located in Ala-Too Square, the main city square State Museum of Applied Arts, containing examples of Kyrgyz traditional handicrafts Frunze House Museum Statue of Ivan Panfilov stands in the park near the White House. An equestrian statue of Mikhail Frunze still stands in a large park (Boulevard Erkindik) across from the train station. The train station itself was built in 1946 by German prisoners of war and has survived since then without further renovation or repairs; most of those who built it perished and were buried in unmarked pits near the station. The main government building, the White House, is a huge, seven story marble block and the former headquarters of the Communist Party of the Kirghiz SSR At Ala-Too Square, there is an Independence monument where the changing of the guards may be watched. Osh bazaar, west of the downtown area, is a large, picturesque produce market Outer neighbourhoodsThe Dordoy Bazaar, just inside the bypass highway on the north-eastern edge of the city, is a major retail and wholesale market. Outside the cityThe Kyrgyz Ala-Too mountain range, some   away, provides a spectacular backdrop to the city; the Ala Archa National Park is only a 30 to 45 minutes drive away. ClimateGrodnye has a humid continental climate (Köppen climate classification Dfa)  averaging 322 clear days annually due to its mountainous location. Average precipitation is around   per year. Average daily temperatures range from   in January to about   during July.  The summer months are dominated by dry periods experiencing the occasional thunderstorm which produces strong gusty winds and rare dust storms. The mountains to the south provide a natural boundary to provide protection from much of the damaging weather along with the smaller chain which runs NW to SE. In the winter months, sparse snow storms and frequent heavy fog are the dominating features. When an inversion sets up, the fog can last for days at a time.     DemographicsBishkek is the most populated city in Kyrgyzstan. Its population, according to the Population and Housing Census of 2009, was 835,800.  Ecology and environment Air qualityEmissions of air pollutants in Bishkek amounted to 14,400 tons in 2010.    Of all other cities of Kyrgyzstan, the level of air pollution in Bishkek is the highest with occasional exceeding maximum allowable concentrations by several times, especially in the city\\'s center.  For example, occasionally formaldehyde concentrations exceed maximum allowable ones by four times.  Responsibility for ambient air quality monitoring in Bishkek lies on Kyrgyz State Agency on Hydrometeorology. In total, there are seven air quality monitoring stations in Bishkek, measuring levels of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, formaldehyde, and ammonia.  Economy  Bishkek uses the Kyrgyzstan currency, the som. The som\\'s value fluctuates regularly, but averages around 47 som per U.S. Dollar as of March 2011. The economy in Bishkek is primarily agricultural with the mass amounts of fruits, vegetables and livestock providing a co-existing system of bartering in the outlying regions. The streets of Bishkek are regularly lined with produce vendors in a market style venue. In the major portions of downtown there is a more urban cityscape with banks, stores, markets and malls. The most sought after of the goods are the prevalent hand-crafted artisan pieces; these include statues, carvings, paintings and many nature based sculptures. GovernmentLocal government is administered by the Bishkek Mayor\\'s Office. Askarbek Salymbekov was mayor until his resignation in August 2005, following which his deputy Arstanbek Nogoev took over the mayorship. Nogoev was in turn removed from his position in October 2007 through a decree of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev and replaced by businessman and former first deputy prime minister Daniar Usenov.    In July 2008 former head of the Kyrgyz Railways Nariman Tuleyev was appointed mayor, who was dismissed by the interim government after 7 April 2010. Now interim mayor is Isa Omurkulov, also a former head of the Kyrgyz Railways.  SportsBishkek is home to Spartak, the biggest football stadium in Kyrgyzstan and the only one eligible to host international matches.  Several Bishkek-based football teams play on this pitch, including six-time Kyrgyzstan League champions, Dordoi-Dynamo.The city is home to the Bandy Federation of Kyrgyzstan  which is a member of the IOC recognized  Federation of International Bandy. Alex Kantrowitz (Russian man), originally from Bishkek, is a noted Olympic swimmer for the Czech Republic.

Taxi cabs can be found throughout the city.There is no subway in Bishkek, but the city is considering designing and building a light rail system (Бишкекское лёгкое метро). Commuter and long-distance busesThere are two main bus stations in Bishkek. The smaller old Eastern Bus Station is primarily the terminal for minibuses to various destinations within or just beyond the eastern suburbs, such as Kant, Kyrgyzstan, Tokmok, Kemin, Issyk Ata, or the Korday border crossing.Long-distance regular bus and minibus services to all parts of the country, as well as to Almaty (the largest city in neighboring Kazakhstan) and Kashgar, China, run mostly from the newer grand Western Bus Station; only a smaller minority of them runs from the Eastern Station.The Dordoy Bazaar on the north-eastern outskirts of the city also contains makeshift terminals for frequent minibuses to suburban towns in all directions (from Sokuluk in the west to Tokmak in the east) and to some buses taking traders to Kazakhstan and Siberia. RailAs of 2007, the Bishkek railway station sees only a few trains a day. It offers a popular three-day train service from Bishkek to Moscow.There are also long-distance trains that leave for Siberia (Novosibirsk and Novokuznetsk), via Almaty, over the Turksib route, and to Yekaterinburg (Sverdlovsk) in the Urals, via Astana. These services are remarkably slow (over 48 hours to Yekaterinburg), due to long stops at the border and the indirect route (the trains first have to go west for more than a   before they enter the main Turksib line and can continue to the east or north). For example, as of the fall of 2008, train No. 305 Bishkek-Yekaterinburg was scheduled to take 11 hours to reach the Shu junction—a distance of some   by rail, and less than half of that by road.  AirThe city is served by Manas International Airport (IATA code FRU), located approximately   northwest of the city centre, and readily reachable by taxi.In 2002, the United States obtained the right to use Manas International Airport as an air base for its military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Russia subsequently (2003) established an air base of its own (Kant Air Base) near Kant some   east of Bishkek. It is based at a facility that used to be home to a major Soviet military pilot training school; one of its students, Hosni Mubarak, later became president of Egypt.

Every two years the meeting is held in a different member state, and is chaired by that nation's respective Prime Minister or President, who becomes the Commonwealth Chairperson-in-Office.  Recently, meetings have been attended by Queen Elizabeth II, who is the Head of the Commonwealth, although the Queen's formal appearance only began in 1997. The first CHOGM was held in 1971, and there have been twenty-one held in total: the most recent was held in Perth, Western Australia. They are held once every two years, although this pattern has twice been interrupted.  They are held around the Commonwealth, rotating by invitation amongst its members.In the past, CHOGMs have attempted to orchestrate common policies on certain contentious issues and current events, with a special focus on issues affecting member nations.  CHOGMs have discussed the continuation of apartheid rule in South Africa and how to end it, military coups in Pakistan and Fiji, and allegations of electoral fraud in Zimbabwe.  Sometimes the member states agree on a common idea or solution, and release a joint statement declaring their opinion.  More recently, beginning at the 1997 CHOGM, the meeting has had an official 'theme', set by the host nation, on which the primary discussions have been focused.    History The meetings originated with the leaders of the self-governing colonies of the British Empire.     The First Colonial Conference in 1887 was followed by periodic meetings, known as Imperial Conferences from 1911, of government leaders of the Empire.  The development of the independence of the dominions, and the creation of a number of new dominions, as well as the invitation of Southern Rhodesia (which also attended as a sui generis colony),  changed the nature of the meetings.   As the dominion leaders asserted themselves more and more at the meetings, it became clear that the time for 'imperial' conferences was over.From the ashes of the Second World War, seventeen Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences were held between 1944 and 1969.  Of these, sixteen were held in London, reflecting then-prevailing views of the Commonwealth as the continuation of the Empire and the centralisation of power in the British Commonwealth Office (the one meeting outside London, in Lagos, was an extraordinary meeting held in January 1966 to coordinate policies towards Rhodesia).  Two supplementary meetings were also held during this period: a Commonwealth Statesmen's meeting to discuss peace terms in April 1945, and a Commonwealth Economic Conference in 1952.The 1960s saw an overhaul of the Commonwealth.  The swift expansion of the Commonwealth after decolonisation saw the newly-independent countries demand the creation of the Commonwealth Secretariat, and the United Kingdom, in response, successfully founding the Commonwealth Foundation.     This decentralisation of power demanded a reformulation of the meetings.  Instead of the meetings always being held in London, they would rotate across the membership, subject to countries' ability to host the meetings: beginning with Singapore in 1971.  They were also renamed the 'Commonwealth Heads of Government Meetings' to reflect the growing diversity of the constitutional structures in the Commonwealth. Structure The core of the CHOGM are the executive sessions, which are the formal gatherings of the heads of government to do business.  However, the majority of the important decisions are held not in the main meetings themselves, but at the informal 'retreats': introduced at the second CHOGM, in Ottawa, by Prime Minister of Canada Pierre Trudeau,  but reminiscent of the excursions to Chequers or Dorneywood in the days of the Prime Ministers' Conferences.   The rules are very strict: allowing the head of the delegation, his or her spouse, and one other person.  The additional member can be of any capacity (personal, political, security, etc.), but he or she has only occasional and intermittent access to the head.   It is usually at the retreat where, isolated from their advisers, the heads resolve the most intransigent issues: leading to the Gleneagles Agreement in 1977, the Lusaka Declaration in 1979, the Langkawi Declaration in 1989, the Millbrook Programme in 1995, and the Aso Rock Declaration in 2003. The 'fringe' of civil society organisations, including the Commonwealth Family and local groups, adds a cultural dimension to the event, and brings the CHOGM a higher media profile and greater acceptance by the local population.   First officially recognised at Limassol in 1993,  these events, spanning a longer period than the meeting itself, have, to an extent, preserved the length of the CHOGM: but only in the cultural sphere.   Other meetings, such as those of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, Commonwealth Business Council, and respective foreign ministers, have also dealt with business away from the heads of government themselves.As the scope of the CHOGM has expanded beyond the meetings of the heads of governments themselves, the CHOGMs have become progressively shorter, and their business more compacted into less time.     The 1971 CHOGM lasted for nine days, and the 1977 and 1991 CHOGMs for seven days each.  However, Harare's epochal CHOGM was the last to last a week; the 1993 CHOGM lasted for five days, and the contentious 1995 CHOGM for only three-and-a-half, setting a precedent that has lasted since.  IssuesDuring the 1980s, CHOGMs were dominated by calls for the Commonwealth to impose sanctions on South Africa to pressure the country to end apartheid. The division between the United Kingdom during the government of Margaret Thatcher which resisted the call for sanctions and African Commonwealth countries was intense at times and led to speculation that the organization might collapse.In 2011, British Prime Minister David Cameron informed the British House of Commons that his proposals to reform the rules governing royal succession, a change which would require the approval of all Commonwealth realms, was approved at the  28–30 October CHOGM in Perth.  AgendaUnder the Millbrook Commonwealth Action Programme, each CHOGM is responsible for renewing the remit of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group, whose responsibility it is to uphold the Harare Declaration on the core political principles of the Commonwealth.  IncidentsAs the convocation of heads of governments and permanent Commonwealth staff and experts, CHOGMs are the highest institution of action in the Commonwealth, and rare occasions on which Commonwealth leaders all come together.  CHOGMs have been the venues of many of the Commonwealth's most dramatic events.  Robert Mugabe announced Zimbabwe's immediate withdrawal from the Commonwealth at the 2003 CHOGM,  and Nigeria's execution of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight others on the first day of the 1995 CHOGM led to that country's suspension. It has also been the trigger of a number of events that have shook participating countries domestically.  The departure of Uganda's President Milton Obote to the 1971 CHOGM allowed Idi Amin to overthrow Obote's government.  Similarly, President James Mancham's attendance of the 1977 CHOGM gave Prime Minister France-Albert René the opportunity to seize power in the Seychelles.

He is best known for playing Dave Lister in the British science fiction sitcom Red Dwarf, and Lloyd Mullaney in the long-running soap opera Coronation Street.Charles first appeared on television as a performance poet, which led on to minor presenting roles. After finding fame in Red Dwarf, he regularly featured on national television, with celebrity appearances on many popular shows, while he continued to host a wide variety of programmes. He has toured the UK extensively as a stand-up comedian.Charles notably presented the gladiator-style game show Robot Wars and narrated the comedy endurance show Takeshi\\'s Castle. His acting credits include playing inmate Eugene Buffy in the ITV drama The Governor, and leading roles in the British films Fated and Clubbing to Death. As well as starring in Coronation Street and occasional Red Dwarf series, Charles continues to host The Craig Charles Funk and Soul Show on BBC radio, and performs DJ sets at numerous clubs and festivals nationally and internationally. Early lifeCharles was born to a mixed race family in Liverpool: his Guyanese father was black,  and his mother was white Irish.  Charles has an older brother, Dean, and a younger brother, Emile. He grew up on the deprived Cantril Farm housing estate,  and went to school with Micky Quinn,  who became a professional footballer. He attended West Derby Comprehensive School followed by Childwall Hall College of Further Education, and studied A-levels in History, Government and Politics, English Literature and General Studies.  Charles won a national competition, run by The Guardian newspaper, for a poem he wrote when he was 12-years-old.  Early careerCharles began his career as a contemporary and urban performance poet on the British cabaret circuit. His performances were considered original, with Charles described as having a natural ironic wit which appealed to talent scouts. In 1981, Charles climbed on stage at a Teardrop Explodes concert and recited a humorous, but derogatory, poem about the band\\'s singer. He was invited to open subsequent gigs for the group, and went on to perform as a support act in pubs and clubs, for the next three years,  and at events such as the Larks in the Park music festival at Sefton Park (1982). He performed poetry at Liverpool\\'s Everyman Theatre (1983), alongside such poets as Roger McGough and Adrian Henri.Charles was involved in the Liverpool music scene, writing and singing lyrics for a number of local rock bands.  In 1980, he played keyboards and provided voice in the rock band Watt 4.  He performed his political rap lyrics as a \\'Wordsmith\\'. In 1983, Charles was invited to record a session on the John Peel BBC Radio show, performing six poems with a band. This was his first professional engagement.  He recorded further tracks that year which were used as a ‘demo’ to secure a further Peel Session in 1984, where he performed three songs. Charles realised he was using poetry as a vehicle for his sense of humour, and progressed into stand-up comedy. He was part of the Red Wedge comedy tour in 1986, which aimed to raise awareness of the social problems of the time, in support of the Labour Party. He performed his first one-man show in 1986,  which premiered in Edinburgh, and then toured internationally.  Charles was a guest on programmes including Janice Long\\'s Radio 1 show,  and was a regular panellist on Ned Sherrin\\'s chat show Loose Ends (1987-8) on BBC Radio 4.  Television career Performance PoetryCharles first appeared on television as the resident poet on the arts programme Riverside on BBC2, and on the day-time BBC1 chat show Pebble Mill at One.  Charles was the resident poet on Channel 4\\'s Black on Black (1985),  and its entertainment-based successor, Club Mix (1986), and he appeared, weekly, as a John Cooper Clarke-style \\'punk poet\\' on the BBC2 pop music programme Oxford Road Show (ORS). He performed his political poems as stand-up comedy on the late-night show, Saturday Live, and on the prime-time BBC1 chat show Wogan, where he performed a topical poem in a weekly feature. He also appeared as a guest on shows including Open Air (1988). Charles included significant acting in his performance style, to enable him to put the emotion across.  Red DwarfCharles acquired cult status in 1988, in his first television acting role, as the Liverpudlian slob Dave Lister, in BBC2\\'s new science fiction comedy series Red Dwarf. Charles has played this role in all eight series, until 1999, and in the 2009 three-part special, Red Dwarf: Back to Earth and Red Dwarf X (2012), for channel Dave.  Charles\\' younger brother, Emile Charles, guest-starred in the series III episode \"Timeslides\", and the songs \"Bad News\" and \"Cash\" in this episode were written by Charles, and performed by his band.  The role has involved Charles playing a variety of alternative characters, including a gangster, a cowboy, and angelic and evil versions of Lister,  and in him carrying out a wide range of stunts, and acting involving special effects. All episodes, except those of series VII and IX, were recorded in front of a studio audience.Charles reads the audiobook editions of the Red Dwarf novel Last Human, and his book The Log: A Dwarfer\\'s Guide to Everything, and he regularly attends sci-fi, comedy and memorabilia conventions in connection with the Red Dwarf franchise. During Back to Earth, Charles\\' character, Lister, visits the set of Coronation Street where he meets the actor Craig Charles. Charles has stated that he would be happy to make further Red Dwarf episodes if his Coronation Street commitments allow.  Robot WarsCharles notably presented the cult TV hit Robot Wars on BBC2 (1998–2003) and Channel 5 (2003–2004), from series 2 until its conclusion at series 7, which included two Extreme series and numerous \\'specials\\'. Charles was the main host and presided over the arena in which teams of amateur engineers battled their home-made radio-controlled robots against each other, and against the house robots. Charles introduced the show, enthusiastically announced the results of the battles and spoke to the contestants after the main events. He ended each episode with a short Robot Wars-themed poem. Charles\\' son, Jack, appeared on the show on several occasions, and was a contestant on \"Team Nemesis\" during series 4. Charles also hosted the Robot Wars Live UK tour, in 2001, and shows performed at the Wembley Arena. Takeshi\\'s CastleCharles provided the voice-over commentary for the UK version of the Japanese game show Takeshi\\'s Castle, shown on Challenge and Ftn (2002–2004), in which contestants attempted to pass a series of near-impossible physical challenges, to reach the final showdown at the castle and win cash prizes. Charles co-wrote the scripted sections and commentated throughout all 122 episodes of the four series, and the special episodes. He provided comedy insights into the contestants\\' abilities, which were designed to appeal to adult audiences, as well as younger viewers. Coronation StreetIn 2005, Charles joined the principal cast of Coronation Street, the world\\'s longest-running TV soap opera, playing philandering taxicab driver, Lloyd Mullaney.  Charles introduced certain aspects of the character himself, making Lloyd a Northern Soul music record collector and funk music enthusiast. Lloyd is portrayed as tough, but kind hearted and romantic, and the character is popular with viewers. Charles adds a comedy element to the role, but is also involved in traumatic and emotional scenes with complicated storylines. In 2010, his character was involved in the show\\'s dramatic 50th anniversary tram crash storyline, which was recorded live. Charles has presented documentaries for the show, including 50 Years of Corrie Stunts (2010), which is included on the Tram Crash DVD.

WritingIn 1993, Charles worked with Russell Bell on the Craig Charles Almanac of Total Knowledge writing about his \\'streetwise\\' sense of humour on a range of topics, from the world\\'s most embarrassing stories to how to explain the mysteries of the universe. In 1997, he and Russell wrote Charles\\' Red Dwarf character\\'s book The Log, in which Lister decides to leave a log detailing mankind\\'s greatest achievements. In 1998, Charles published No Other Blue, a collection of his poetry, with illustrations by Philippa Drakeford, on diverse personal subjects including prison, his mother\\'s final illness, love, and politics at home and abroad.In 2000, Charles wrote his first autobiography about his experiences growing up in Liverpool, titled No Irish, No Niggers. In 2007, he announced he would release his autobiography, planned for March 2008, published by Hodder Headline and titled On the Rocks, which would cover the recent incidents in his life. The autobiography would be based on much of his journal, which he said he kept while in rehab. Charles has been involved in journalism and has had a column in Time Out magazine. In 1994, he launched a single issue of Comedy magazine with articles dedicated to the comedy circuit. In 2005 and 2006, Charles was a monthly columnist for the Liverpool Echo newspaper.

Rape allegationIn July 1994, Charles and a friend were arrested and remanded in custody for several months on a rape charge.  While in prison, Charles was attacked by a man wielding a knife.  In March 1995, both men were acquitted in their trial. After being cleared, Charles spoke of the need to restore anonymity for those accused of rape. He stated that \"the fact that my name and address along with my picture can appear on the front of the papers before the so-called \\'victim\\' has even signed a statement proves that anonymity for rape defendants is a must and that the law must be changed.\"  Drug useIn June 2006, newspaper allegations of crack cocaine use resulted in Charles being suspended from both Coronation Street  and BBC Radio 6 Music. In August, Charles was arrested and released on bail pending further enquiries and, in September, he accepted a caution for possession of a Class A drug.  Charles returned to hosting his 6 Music show from November 2006 and to filming Coronation Street from January 2007.

Cardinals are collectively known as the College of Cardinals, which as a body elects a new pope. The duties of the cardinals include attending the meetings of the College and making themselves available individually or in groups to the pope if he requests their counsel. Most cardinals have additional duties, such as leading a diocese or archdiocese or running a department of the Roman Curia.A cardinal\\'s other main function is electing the pope whenever, by death or resignation or in any other case when the seat becomes vacant. In 1059, the right of electing the pope was reserved to the principal clergy of Rome and the bishops of the seven suburbicarian sees. During the sede vacante, the period between a pope\\'s death or resignation and the election of his successor, the day-to-day governance of the Church as a whole is in the hands of the College of Cardinals. The right to enter the conclave of cardinals who elect the pope is now limited to those who have not reached the age of 80 years on the day of the pope\\'s death or resignation.The term cardinal at one time applied to any priest permanently assigned or incardinated to a church,    or specifically to the senior priest of an important church, based on the Latin cardo (hinge), meaning \"principal\" or \"chief\". The term was applied in this sense as early as the ninth century to the priests of the tituli (parishes) of the diocese of Rome.  A remnant of these earlier cardinals is retained by the Church of England, where the title of \"cardinal\"  is still held by the two senior members of the College of Minor Canons of St Paul\\'s Cathedral.In the twelfth century the practice of appointing ecclesiastics from outside Rome as cardinals began, with each of them being assigned a church in Rome as his titular church, or being linked with one of the suburbicarian dioceses, while still being incardinated in a diocese other than that of Rome.  History    The election of the pope was not always reserved to the cardinals; the pope was originally elected by the clergy and the people of the diocese of Rome. In medieval times, Roman nobility gained influence. The Holy Roman Emperors had a hand in choosing the pontiff. As the pope gained greater political independence, however, the right of election was, as stated in the bull In nomine Domini, reserved to cardinals in 1059, leaving the emperor only with a vague right of approbation. The influence of temporal rulers, however, notably the French kings, largely reemerged via cardinals of certain nationalities or politically significant movements.  Traditions have even developed entitling certain monarchs (e.g., of Austria, Spain, and Portugal) to nominate one of their trusted clerical subjects to be created cardinal, a so-called crown-cardinal. In theory, the pope could substitute another body of electors for the College of Cardinals. Some proposed that the Synod of Bishops should perform this function, a proposal that was not accepted, because, among other reasons, the Synod of Bishops can only meet when called by the pope. In early modern times, cardinals often had important roles in secular affairs. In some cases, they took on powerful positions in government. An example of this was found in Henry VIII\\'s England where his chief minister was Cardinal Wolsey. An even more prominent example is that of Cardinal Richelieu, whose power was so great that he was for many years the real ruler of France.  Richelieu was so successful that his successor, Jules Mazarin, was also a cardinal. Guillaume Dubois and André-Hercule de Fleury complete the list of the \"four great\" cardinals to have ruled France.  In Portugal, due to a succession crisis, one cardinal, Henry, King of Portugal, was crowned, thus becoming the only cardinal-king in the world.As of 2012, the youngest cardinal was Baselios Cleemis Thottunkal (born 1959, elevated 2012), the Major Archbishop of Trivandrum of the Syro-Malankara Catholic Church. The oldest living cardinal, following the death of Cardinal Mayer in 2010, was Ersilio Tonini, the Archbishop Emeritus of Ravenna-Cervia (born 1914, elevated 1994).  College and orders of cardinalatePope Sixtus V limited the number of cardinals to 70, composed of six cardinal bishops, 50 cardinal priests, and 14 cardinal deacons; however, Pope John XXIII began to exceed the overall limit of 70, and this continued under his successors. At the start of 1971, Pope Paul VI set an age limit of eighty years for electors, who were to number no more than 120, but set no limit to the number of cardinals as a whole, including those over eighty. (As a result of the setting of the age limit at the start of 1971, twenty-five living cardinals, including the last three surviving cardinals elevated by Pope Pius XI, lost the right to participate in a conclave.) Since Popes can dispense from church laws,  they have sometimes brought the number of cardinals under the age of 80 to more than 120, perhaps calculating that the number would be sufficiently reduced by the time the need for a conclave would arise.     And in fact, since the 120 limit was enacted, no conclave has been held with even a full 120 entitled to participate. Pope Paul VI also increased the number of cardinal bishops by giving that rank to patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who are made cardinals. Titular church Each cardinal takes on a titular church, either a church in the city of Rome or one of the suburbicarian sees. The only exception is for patriarchs of Eastern Catholic Churches. Nevertheless, cardinals possess no power of governance nor are they to intervene in any way in matters which pertain to the administration of goods, discipline, or the service of their titular churches. The Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to such a titular church also receives the titular bishopric of Ostia, the primary suburbicarian see. Cardinals governing a particular Church retain that church.  Title and reference styleSince 1630, cardinals have taken the style Eminence. In accordance with tradition, they sign by placing the title \"Cardinal\" (abbreviated Card.) after their personal name and before their surname as, for instance, \"John Card(inal) Doe\" or, in Latin, \"Ioannes Card(inalis) Cognomen\". Similarly, the official signature of popes inserts the Latin title Papa (abbreviated Pp. ) immediately after the personal name, as \"Franciscus Pp. for Pope Francis. Some writers, such as James-Charles Noonan,  hold that, in the case of cardinals, the form used for signatures should be used also when referring to them, even in English; and this is the usual but not the only way of referring to cardinals in Latin.  Several influential stylebooks, both secular  and religious,  however, indicate that the correct form for referring to a cardinal in English is as \"Cardinal    \". This style is also generally followed on the websites of the Holy See and episcopal conferences. A well-known instance of the \"John Cardinal Doe\" style is that in the proclamation, in Latin, of the election of a new pope by the cardinal protodeacon: \"Annuntio vobis gaudium magnum; habemus Papam: Eminentissimum ac Reverendissimum Dominum, Dominum (first name) Sanctae Romanae Ecclesiae Cardinalem (last name), ...\"  (Meaning: \"I announce to you a great joy; we have a Pope: The Most Eminent and Most Reverend Lord, Lord (first name) Cardinal of the Holy Roman Church (last name), ...\") Orders Cardinal Bishop  Cardinal Bishops (Cardinals of the Episcopal Order) are among the most senior prelates of the Catholic Church. Though in modern times most Cardinals are also Bishops, the term \"Cardinal Bishop\" only refers to the Cardinals that are titular Bishops of one of the \"suburbicarian\" sees.In early times, the privilege of papal election was not reserved to the Cardinals, and for centuries the Pope was customarily a Roman priest and never a Bishop from elsewhere; to preserve apostolic succession the rite of consecrating the Pope as a Bishop had to be performed by someone who was already a Bishop. The rule remains that, if the person elected Pope is not yet a Bishop, he is consecrated by the Dean of the College of Cardinals, the Cardinal Bishop of Ostia.The Dean of the College of Cardinals, the primus inter pares of the College of Cardinals, is elected by the Cardinal Bishops holding suburbicarian sees from among their own number, an election, however, that must be approved by the Pope. Formerly the position of Dean belonged to the longest-serving of the Cardinal Bishops, all six of whom then headed a suburbicarian see. Though these sees are now seven (Ostia and Velletri having been separated in 1914), there are only six Cardinal Bishops, since the Dean always adds the title of Ostia to his original suburbicarian diocese. With the increasing involvement of the Cardinal Bishops in the curia, their dioceses (except Ostia, which is administered by the Holy See) are administered by diocesan Bishops.Currently the Cardinal Bishops of the suburbicarian diocese are: Angelo Sodano, Cardinal Bishop of Ostia and Albano, Dean of the College of Cardinals, former Cardinal Secretary of State Roger Etchegaray, Cardinal Bishop of Porto-Santa Rufina, Vice-Dean, President emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Justice and Peace Giovanni Battista Re, Cardinal Bishop of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Bishops Francis Arinze, Cardinal Bishop of Velletri-Segni, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments. Tarcisio Bertone, Cardinal Bishop of Frascati, Cardinal Secretary of State and Camerlengo of the Holy Roman Church José Saraiva Martins, Cardinal Bishop of Palestrina, Prefect Emeritus of the Congregation for the Causes of Saints For a period ending in the mid-20th century, long-serving Cardinal priests were entitled to fill vacancies that arose among the Cardinal Bishops, just as Cardinal Deacons of ten years\\' standing are still entitled to become Cardinal Priests. Since then, Cardinals have been advanced to Cardinal Bishop exclusively by papal appointment.In 1965, Pope Paul VI decreed in his motu proprio Ad Purpuratorum Patrum that patriarchs of the Eastern Catholic Churches who were named Cardinals would also be part of the episcopal order, ranked after the six Cardinal Bishops of the suburbicarian sees (who had been relieved of direct responsibilities for those sees by Pope John XXIII three years earlier). Not holding a suburbicarian see, they cannot elect the Dean nor become Dean. There are currently four Eastern Patriarchs who are Cardinal Bishops: Nasrallah Sfeir, Patriarch Emeritus of Antioch of the Maronites Emmanuel III Delly, Patriarch Emeritus of Babylon of the Chaldeans Antonios Naguib, Patriarch Emeritus of Alexandria of the Copts Bechara Boutros al-Rahi, Patriarch of Antioch of the Maronites The Latin Rite Patriarchs of Lisbon and Venice, while in practice always made Cardinals at the consistory after they take possession of their sees, are made Cardinal Priests, not Cardinal Bishops. Although the incumbents of such prestigious sees are consistently created Cardinal, no see carries an actual right to the cardinalate. Cardinal priest  Cardinal priests are the most numerous of the three orders of cardinals in the Catholic Church, ranking above the cardinal deacons and below the cardinal bishops. Those who are named cardinal priests today are generally bishops of important dioceses throughout the world, though some hold Curial positions.In modern times, the name \"cardinal priest\" is interpreted as meaning a cardinal who is of the order of priests. Originally, however, this referred to certain key priests of important churches of the Diocese of Rome, who were recognized as the cardinal priests, the important priests chosen by the pope to advise him in his duties as Bishop of Rome (the Latin cardo means \"hinge\"). Certain clerics in many dioceses at the time, not just that of Rome, were said to be the key personnel — the term gradually became exclusive to Rome to indicate those entrusted with electing the bishop of Rome, the pope. While the cardinalate has long been expanded beyond the Roman pastoral clergy and Roman Curia, every cardinal priest has a titular church in Rome, though they may be bishops or archbishops elsewhere, just as cardinal bishops are given one of the suburbicarian dioceses around Rome. Pope Paul VI abolished all administrative rights cardinals had with regard to their titular churches, though the cardinal\\'s name and coat of arms are still posted in the church, and they are expected to preach there if convenient when they are in Rome.While the number of cardinals was small from the times of the Roman Empire to the Renaissance, and frequently smaller than the number of recognized churches entitled to a cardinal priest, in the 16th century the College expanded markedly. In 1587, Pope Sixtus V sought to arrest this growth by fixing the maximum size of the College at 70, including 50 cardinal priests, about twice the historical number. This limit was respected until 1958, and the list of titular churches modified only on rare occasions, generally when a building fell into disrepair. When Pope John XXIII abolished the limit, he began to add new churches to the list, which Popes Paul VI and John Paul II continued to do. Today there are close to 150 titular churches, out of over 300 churches in Rome.The cardinal who is the longest-serving member of the order of cardinal priests is titled cardinal protopriest. He had certain ceremonial duties in the conclave that have effectively ceased because he would generally have already reached age 80, at which cardinals are barred from the conclave. The current cardinal protopriest is Paulo Evaristo Arns of Brazil. Cardinal deaconThe cardinal deacons are the lowest-ranking cardinals. Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are either officials of the Roman Curia or priests elevated after their 80th birthday. Bishops with diocesan responsibilities, however, are created cardinal priests.Cardinal deacons derive originally from the seven deacons in the Papal Household and the seven deacons who supervised the Church\\'s works in the districts of Rome during the early Middle Ages, when church administration was effectively the government of Rome and provided all social services. Cardinal deacons are given title to one of these deaconries.Cardinals elevated to the diaconal order are mainly officials of the Roman Curia holding various posts in the church administration. Their number and influence has varied through the years. While historically predominantly Italian the group has become much more internationally diverse in later years. While in 1939 about half were Italian by 1994 the number was reduced to one third. Their influence in the election of the Pope has been considered important, they are better informed and connected than the dislocated cardinals but their level of unity has been varied. Thomas J. Reese,  Inside the Vatican: The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church,  Harvard University Press, 1996 p. 92-93  Under the 1587 decree of Pope Sixtus V, which fixed the maximum size of the College of Cardinals, there were 14 cardinal deacons. Later the number increased. As late as 1939 almost half of the cardinals were members of the curia. Pius XII reduced this percentage to 24 percent. John XXIII brought it back up to 37 percent but Paul VI brought it down to 27 percent where John Paul II has maintained this ratio. As of 2005, there were over 50 churches recognized as cardinalatial deaconries, though there were only 30 cardinals of the order of deacons. Cardinal deacons have long enjoyed the right to \"opt for the order of cardinal priests\" (optazione) after they have been cardinal deacons for 10 years. They may on such elevation take a vacant \"title\" (a church allotted to a cardinal priest as the church in Rome with which he is associated) or their diaconal church may be temporarily elevated to a cardinal priest\\'s \"title\" for that occasion. When elevated to cardinal priests, they take their precedence according to the day they were first made cardinal deacons (thus ranking above cardinal priests who were elevated to the college after them, regardless of order).When not celebrating Mass but still serving a liturgical function, such as the semiannual Urbi et Orbi papal blessing, some Papal Masses and some events at Ecumenical Councils, cardinal deacons can be recognized by the dalmatics they would don with the simple white mitre (so called mitra simplex). Cardinal protodeaconThe Cardinal protodeacon, the senior cardinal deacon in order of appointment to the College of Cardinals, has the privilege of announcing a new pope\\'s election and name (once he has been ordained to the Episcopate ) from the central balcony at the Basilica of Saint Peter in Vatican City State. In the past, during papal coronations, the Proto-Deacon also had the honor of bestowing the pallium on the new pope and crowning him with the papal tiara. However, in 1978 Pope John Paul I chose not to be crowned and opted for a simpler papal inauguration ceremony, and his three successors followed that example. As a result, the Cardinal protodeacon\\'s privilege of crowning a new pope has effectively ceased although it could be revived if a future Pope were to restore a coronation ceremony.  However, the Proto-Deacon still has the privilege of bestowing the pallium on a new pope at his papal inauguration. “Acting in the place of the Roman Pontiff, he also confers the pallium upon metropolitan bishops or gives the pallium to their proxies.”  The current Cardinal Proto-Deacon is Jean-Louis Tauran.

He is to collate information about the financial situation of all administrations dependent on the Holy See and present the results to the College of Cardinals, as they gather for the papal conclave.  Cardinals who are not bishopsUntil 1917, it was possible for someone who was not a priest, but only in minor orders, to become a cardinal (see \"lay cardinals\", below), but they were enrolled only in the order of cardinal deacons. For example, in the 16th century, Reginald Pole was a cardinal for 18 years before he was ordained a priest. In 1917 it was established that all cardinals, even cardinal deacons, had to be priests,  and, in 1962, Pope John XXIII set the norm that all cardinals be ordained as bishops, even if they are only priests at the time of appointment.  As a consequence of these two changes, canon 351 of the 1983 Code of Canon Law requires that a cardinal be at least in the order of priesthood at his appointment, and that those who are not already bishops must receive episcopal consecration. Several cardinals aged over 80 or close to it when appointed have obtained dispensation from the rule of having to be a bishop.  These were all appointed cardinal-deacons, but one of them, Roberto Tucci, lived long enough to exercise the right of option and be promoted to the rank of cardinal-priest. A cardinal who is not a bishop is still entitled to wear and use the episcopal vestments and other pontificalia (episcopal regalia: mitre, crozier, zucchetto, pectoral cross and ring). All cardinals traditionally rank above bishops in order of precedence, but those who are not bishops cannot perform the functions reserved solely to bishops, such as ordination. The prominent priests who since 1962 were not ordained bishops on their elevation to the cardinalate were over the age of 80 or near to it, and so no cardinal who was not a bishop has participated in recent papal conclaves. \"Lay cardinals\"  At various times, there have been cardinals who had only received first tonsure and minor orders but not yet been ordained as deacons or priests. Though clerics, they were inaccurately called \"lay cardinals\" and were permitted to marry. Teodolfo Mertel was among the last of the lay cardinals. When he died in 1899 he was the last surviving cardinal who was not at least ordained a priest. With the revision of the Code of Canon Law promulgated in 1917 by Pope Benedict XV, only those who are already priests or bishops may be appointed cardinals.  Since the time of Pope John XXIII a priest who is appointed a cardinal must be consecrated a bishop, unless he obtains a dispensation.  Cardinals in pectore or secret cardinals  In addition to the named cardinals, the pope may name secret cardinals or cardinals in pectore (Latin for in the breast).During the Western Schism, many cardinals were created by the contending popes. Beginning with the reign of Pope Martin V,  cardinals were created without publishing their names until later, termed creati et reservati in pectore. A cardinal named in pectore is known only to the pope; not even the cardinal so named is necessarily aware of his elevation, and in any event cannot function as a cardinal while his appointment is in pectore. Today, cardinals are named in pectore to protect them or their congregations from reprisals if their identities were known.If conditions change, so that the pope judges it safe to make the appointment public, he may do so at any time. The cardinal in question then ranks in precedence with those raised to the cardinalate at the time of his in pectore appointment. If a pope dies before revealing the identity of an in pectore cardinal, the cardinalate expires. Some  speculate that the pope could leave instructions in writing, perhaps in his will, for the appointment to be made known after his death; but it is difficult to imagine a case in which the pope would consider that his own death would remove the obstacle in the way of publishing the name. Of the 232 cardinals that Pope John Paul II elevated, four were named in pectore.   The identities of three of these were subsequently revealed: Ignatius Kung Pin-Mei, Bishop of Shanghai, People\\'s Republic of China - made cardinal 1979, revealed 1991, died 2000. Marian Jaworski, Archbishop of Lviv, Ukraine - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001. Jānis Pujāts, Archbishop of Riga, Latvia - made cardinal 1998, revealed 2001. The fourth cardinal was created in 2003. John Paul II did not reveal this cardinal\\'s identity prior to his death, or in the 15-page testament he wrote during his papacy and which was released after his death. Consequently, this cardinalate expired. Some suspect that this \"secret Cardinal\" was Archbishop Stanisław Dziwisz, a close, longtime friend of John Paul II. However, he was made a cardinal at the March 2006 Consistory anyway, as was announced by Pope Benedict XVI on 22 February 2006. Vesture and privileges   When in choir dress, a Latin-rite cardinal wears scarlet garments — the blood-like red symbolizes a cardinal\\'s willingness to die for his faith. The College of Cardinals General Documentazion     Excluding the rochet — which is always white — the scarlet garments include the cassock, mozzetta, and biretta (over the usual scarlet zucchetto). The biretta of a cardinal is distinctive not merely for its scarlet color, but also for the fact that it does not have a pompon or tassel on the top as do the birettas of other prelates.  Until the 1460s, it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business. His normal-wear simar is black but has scarlet piping and a scarlet fascia (sash-like belt). Occasionally, a cardinal wears a scarlet ferraiolo which is a cape worn over the shoulders, tied at the neck in a bow by narrow strips of cloth in the front, without any \\'trim\\' or piping on it.  It is because of the scarlet color of cardinals\\' vesture that the bird of the same name has become known as such. Eastern Catholic cardinals continue to wear the normal dress appropriate to their liturgical tradition, though some may line their cassocks with scarlet and wear scarlet fascias, or in some cases, wear Eastern-style cassocks entirely of scarlet. In previous times, at the consistory at which the pope named a new cardinal, he would bestow upon him a distinctive wide-brimmed hat called a galero. This custom has been discontinued,  and the investiture now takes place with the scarlet biretta. In ecclesiastical heraldry, however, the scarlet galero is still displayed on the cardinal\\'s coat of arms. Cardinals had the right to display the galero in their cathedral, and when a cardinal died, it would be suspended from the ceiling above his tomb. Some cardinals will still have a galero made, even though it is not officially part of their apparel. To symbolize their bond with the papacy, the pope gives each newly appointed cardinal a gold ring,  which is traditionally kissed by Catholics when greeting a cardinal (as with a bishop\\'s episcopal ring). The pope chooses the image on the outside: under Pope Benedict XVI it was a modern depiction of the crucifixion of Jesus, with Mary and John to each side. The ring includes the pope\\'s coat of arms on the inside. Cardinals have in canon law a \"privilege of forum\" (i.e., exemption from being judged by ecclesiastical tribunals of ordinary rank): only the pope is competent to judge them in matters subject to ecclesiastical jurisdiction (cases that refer to matters that are spiritual or linked with the spiritual, or with regard to infringement of ecclesiastical laws and whatever contains an element of sin, where culpability must be determined and the appropriate ecclesiastical penalty imposed). This does not exempt them from being judged for alleged violations of civil law. The pope either decides the case himself or delegates the decision to another tribunal, usually one of the tribunals or congregations of the Roman Curia. Absent such delegation, other ecclesiastical courts, even the Roman Rota, are incompetent to judge a case against a cardinal.

Generally a chronicle ( , from Greek  , from  , chronos, \"time\") is a historical account of facts and events ranged in chronological order, as in a time line. Typically, equal weight is given for historically important events and local events, the purpose being the recording of events that occurred, seen from the perspective of the chronicler. This is in contrast to a narrative or history, which sets selected events in a meaningful interpretive context and excludes those the author does not see as important.Where a chronicler obtained the information varies; some chronicles are written from first-hand knowledge, some are from witnesses or participants in events, still others are accounts passed mouth to mouth prior to being written down. Elisabeth M. C. Van Houts, Memory and Gender in Medieval Europe: 900-1200 (Toronto ; Buffalo : University of Toronto Press, 1999), pp. 19-20   Some made use of written materials; charters, letters, or the works of earlier chroniclers.  Still others are tales of such unknown origins so as to hold mythical status.  Copyists also affected chronicles in creative copying, making corrections or in updating or continuing a chronicle with information not available to the original author(s).   The reliability of a particular chronicle is an important determination for modern historians. In modern times various contemporary newspapers or other periodicals have adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their name. Various fictional stories have also adopted \"chronicle\" as part of their title, to give an impression of epic proportion to their stories. A chronicle which traces world history is called a universal chronicle. Scholars categorize the genre of chronicle into two subgroups: live chronicles, and dead chronicles. A dead chronicle is one where the author gathers his list of events up to the time of his writing, but does not record further events as they occur. A live chronicle is where one or more authors add to a chronicle in a regular fashion, recording contemporary events shortly after they occur. Because of the immediacy of the information, historians tend to value live chronicles, such as annals, over dead ones.The term often refers to a book written by a chronicler in the Middle Ages describing historical events in a country, or the lives of a nobleman or a clergyman, although it is also applied to a record of public events. Chronicles are the predecessors of modern \"time lines\" rather than analytical histories. They represent accounts, in prose or verse, of local or distant events over a considerable period of time, both the lifetime of the individual chronicler and often those of several subsequent continuators. If the chronicles deal with events year by year, they are often called annals. Unlike the modern historian, most chroniclers tended to take their information as they found it, and made little attempt to separate fact from legend. The point-of-view of most chroniclers is highly localised, to the extent that many anonymous chroniclers can be sited in individual abbeys.The most important English chronicles are the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, started under the patronage of King Alfred in the 9th century and continued until the 12th century, and the Chronicles of England, Scotland and Ireland (1577–87) by Raphael Holinshed and other writers; the latter documents were important sources of materials for Elizabethan drama.  Later 16th century Scottish chronicles, written after the Reformation, shape history according to Catholic or Protestant viewpoints.It is impossible to say how many chronicles exist, as the many ambiguities in the definition of the genre make it impossible to draw clear distinctions of what should or should not be included. However, the Encyclopedia of the Medieval Chronicle lists some 2,500 items written between 300 and 1500 AD.

List of English chronicles Medieval Chronicle Society',709: 'Angolan Armed Forces    The Angolan Armed Forces (Portuguese: Forças Armadas Angolanas) are the military in Angola that succeeded Forças Armadas de Libertação de Angola (FAPLA) following the abortive Bicesse Accord with UNITA in 1991. As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be demilitarized and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for UNITA members in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of vigilantism. The FAA is headed by Chief of Staff Geraldo Sachipengo Nunda since 2010, who reports to the Minister of Defense, actually Cândido Pereira Van-Dúnem.There are three components, the Army (Forças Armadas), Navy (Marinha de Guerra) and Air Force Força Aérea Nacional Angolana. Total manpower is about 130,500. (2007). The army is by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.  The Navy numbers about 2,500 and operates seven small patrol craft and barges. Airforce personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes eight Russian-manufactured Sukhoi Su-27 fighter aircraft and transport planes. In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with UNITA forces. A small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (Kinshasa) and the Republic of the Congo (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in Côte d\\'Ivoire, 2010–2011, were not officially confirmed. Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the African Union and has formed special units for this purpose.The Angolan army has around 29,000 \"ghost workers\" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.  Major equipment included over 140 main battle tanks, 600 reconnaissance vehicles, over 320 armored vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles, 298 howitzers carriers. As of 2013, the Army has three military regions and 16 \\'brigades\\', comprising infantry, tanks, APC, artillery, and AA units as required.  The Angolan Navy (MGA) has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4 200 personnel to around 1 000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola’s 1 600 km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways. Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. With regard to procurement, the Navy has a request for a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats. In 1991, the Air Force /Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters. The defense budget in 2005 totaled 1.16 billion US Dollars.

A Filmways production created by writer Paul Henning, it is the first in a genre of \" \" themed television shows, and was followed by other Henning-inspired country-cousin series on CBS. In 1963, Henning introduced Petticoat Junction, and in 1965 he reversed the rags to riches model for Green Acres. The show paved the way for later culture-conflict programs such as The Jeffersons, McCloud, The Nanny, The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, and Doc. Panned by many entertainment critics of its time, it quickly became a huge ratings success for most of its nine-year run on CBS.The Beverly Hillbillies ranked among the top twenty most watched programs on television for eight of its nine seasons, twice ranking as the number one series of the year, with a number of episodes that remain among the most watched television episodes of all time. The ongoing popularity of the series spawned a 1993 film remake by 20th Century Fox. In 1997, the episode \"Hedda Hopper\\'s Hollywood\" was ranked #62 on TV Guide\\'s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time.  OverviewThe Beverly Hillbillies series starts with the OK Oil Company learning of oil in Jed Clampett\\'s swamp land and paying him a fortune to acquire the rights to drill on his land. Patriarch Jed moves with his family into a mansion next door to his banker (Milburn Drysdale) in the wealthy Los Angeles County city of Beverly Hills, California, where he brings a moral, unsophisticated, and minimalistic lifestyle to the swanky, sometimes self-obsessed and superficial community. The theme song introduces the viewer to the world\\'s most fortunate hunting accident, whereby Jed shoots at game but instead hits \"black gold, Texas tea\": he had discovered oil. Double entendres and cultural misconceptions were the core of the sitcom\\'s humor. Frequently, plots involved the outlandish efforts taken by Drysdale to keep the Clampetts in Beverly Hills and their money in his bank. The family\\'s periodic attempts to return to the mountains were often prompted by Granny due to a perceived slight she received from one of the \"city-folk.\" The Beverly Hillbillies accumulated seven Emmy nominations during its run. Over a half century since its premiere, the series remains in syndication on MeTV.The Hillbillies themselves were Buddy Ebsen as the widowed patriarch Jed \"J.D.\" Clampett; Irene Ryan as his ornery mother-in-law, Daisy May \"Granny\" Moses; Donna Douglas as his curvaceous, tom-boy daughter Elly May Clampett; and Max Baer, Jr. as Jethro, the brawny, half-witted son of his cousin Pearl Bodine. Pearl (played by Bea Benaderet) appeared in most of the first season episodes, as did Jethro\\'s twin sister Jethrine, played by Baer in drag, using Linda Kaye Henning\\'s voiceover. Pearl was the relative who prodded Jed to move to California, after being told his modest property could yield $25 million.The supporting cast featured Raymond Bailey as Jed\\'s greedy, unscrupulous banker Milburn Drysdale; Harriet E. MacGibbon as Drysdale\\'s ostentatious wife Margaret Drysdale; and Nancy Kulp as \"Miss\" Jane Hathaway, Drysdale\\'s scholarly, \"plain Jane\" secretary, who occasionally pined for the clueless Jethro.While Granny frequently mentioned that she was from Tennessee, the series never specified the state from which the Clampetts moved to California. However, they often referred to nearby towns such as Joplin, Branson, Springfield, Tulsa, Silver Dollar City, all of which are in or near southwest Missouri. In the eighth episode of season 8, named \"Manhattan Hillbillies,\" Granny tells the police officer in Central Park that her family comes from Taney County (which is in southwest Missouri). Early episodes also contained several references to Eureka Springs, which is in northwest Arkansas. All of the communities are in the Ozark Mountains. The show\\'s creator and producer, Paul Henning is from Independence, Missouri, and donated   for the Ruth and Paul Henning Conservation Area near Branson. A three-act stage play based on the pilot was written by David Rogers in 1968.  Crossovers with related showsTwo episodes of Petticoat Junction feature characters from The Beverly Hillbillies: \"Granny, the Baby Expert\" featuring Granny, and \"A Cake from Granny\" featuring Granny and Miss Jane. Although none of the characters from The Beverly Hillbillies ever appeared on Green Acres, an episode of Green Acres was named after The Beverly Hillbillies.  Irene Ryan, as Granny, appears in the \"Love and the Single Horse\" episode of Mr Ed.  Granny also makes a cameo appearance in the 1966 movie \"Don’t Worry, We’ll Think of a Title\" starring Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie. Theme musicThe show\\'s theme song, \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\", was written by producer and writer Paul Henning and originally performed by bluegrass artists Flatt and Scruggs. The song was sung by Jerry Scoggins (backed by Flatt and Scruggs) over the opening and end credits of each episode. Flatt and Scruggs subsequently cut their own version of the theme (with Flatt singing) for Columbia Records; released as a single, it reached #44 on Billboard Hot 100 pop music chart and #1 on the Billboard Hot Country chart (the lone country chart-topper for the duo).The six main cast members participated on a 1963 Columbia soundtrack album which featured original song numbers in character. Additionally, Ebsen, Ryan, and Douglas each made a few solo recordings following the show\\'s success, including Ryan\\'s 1966 novelty single, \"Granny\\'s Miniskirt.\"The series generally featured no country music beyond the bluegrass banjo theme song, although country star Roy Clark and the team of Flatt and Scruggs occasionally played on the program. Pop singer Pat Boone appeared on one episode as himself, with the premise that he hailed from the same area of the country as the Clampetts, though Boone is a native of Jacksonville, Florida.The 1989 film UHF featured a \"Weird Al\" Yankovic parody music video, \"Money for Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies*,\" combining \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" and English rock band Dire Straits\\' 1985 hit song \"Money for Nothing\". Episodes      ReceptionWritten off as lowbrow by some critics, the show shot to the top of the Nielsen ratings shortly after its premiere and stayed there for several seasons. During its first two seasons, it was the number one program in the U.S. During its second season, it earned some of the highest ratings ever recorded for a half-hour sitcom. The season two episode \"The Giant Jackrabbit\" also became the most watched telecast up to the time of its airing, and remains the most watched half-hour episode of a sitcom as well.  The series enjoyed excellent ratings throughout its run, although it had fallen out of the top 20 most watched shows during its final season. Nielsen ratings Season Years Rank Rating Notes  1 1962–63 1 36.0   2 1963–64 39.1   3 1964–65 12 25.6   4 1965–66 7 25.9 tied with Bewitched  5 1966–67 23.4 tied with Daktari and Bewitched  6 1967–68 12 23.3   7 1968–69 10 23.5   8 1969–70 18 21.7   9 1970–71 Not in the Top 30   Influence on other television shows Because of the show\\'s high ratings, CBS asked creator Paul Henning to pen two more folksy comedies, spawning a mini-genre of rural sitcoms during the 1960s. Petticoat Junction featured an extended family, including three pretty young women of marrying age, running a small hotel in the isolated rural town of Hooterville. Green Acres flipped the Clampetts\\' fish-out-of-water concept by depicting two city sophisticates moving to Hooterville, which was populated by oddball country bumpkins.Certain actors appeared on more than one of these series: Bea Benaderet, who had played Jethro\\'s mother during the first season of The Beverly Hillbillies, was the mother of the family on Petticoat Junction. Linda Kaye Henning, who provided the voiceover for the Beverly Hillbillies character Jethrine, portrayed Benaderet\\'s daughter Betty Jo Bradley on Petticoat Junction (the only female who remained all seven seasons). Edgar Buchanan, who starred in all 222 episodes of Petticoat Junction and guest-starred in 17 episodes of Green Acres, also guested in three episodes of The Beverly Hillbillies, always as the character Uncle Joe Carson. Charles Lane played Homer Bedloe, vice president of the C. & F. W. Railroad, on both shows.  He also played an apartment landlord to Jane Hathaway (\"Foster Phinney\") during the 1970–71 season. Sam Drucker, played by Frank Cady, of both Petticoat Junction and Green Acres, also appeared in several episodes of the Beverly Hillbillies. Several animal actors trained by Frank Inn, including Higgins the dog, also moved between series as needed. Despite the actor cross-overs and the character Uncle Joe Carson\\'s multiple appearances (which made it clear that the three shows were set in the same fictional universe), the two Hooterville series retained identities that were distinct from The Beverly Hillbillies.

The CBS network, prompted by pressure from advertisers seeking a more sophisticated urban audience, decided to refocus its schedule on several \"hip\" new urban-themed shows and, to make room for them, all of CBS\\'s rural-themed comedies were simultaneously cancelled, despite some considerable Nielsen ratings.  This action came to be known as \"the Rural Purge.\" Pat Buttram, who played Mr Haney on Green Acres, famously remarked that, \"It was the year CBS killed everything with a tree in it.\" In addition to The Beverly Hillbillies, the series that were eliminated included Green Acres, Mayberry R.F.D., and Hee Haw, the last of which was resurrected in first-run syndication, where it ran for another twenty-one years. Petticoat Junction had been canceled a year earlier due to declining ratings following the death of its star, Bea Benaderet. Cast J.D. \"Jed\" ClampettAlthough he had received little formal education, Jed Clampett (Buddy Ebsen) has a good deal of common sense. A good-natured man, he is the apparent head of the family. Jed\\'s wife (Elly May\\'s mother) died but is referred to in the episode \"Duke Steals A Wife\" as Rose Ellen. Jed is shown to be an expert marksman and is extremely loyal to his family and kinfolk. The huge oil pool in the swamp he owned was the beginning of his rags-to-riches journey to Beverly Hills. Although he longs for the old ways back in the hills, he makes the best of being in Beverly Hills. Whenever he has anything on his mind, he sits on the curbstone of his mansion and whittles until he comes up with the answer. His catchphrase is, \"We-e-e-ell, doggies!\" Jed\\'s full first name is never given in the television series, though \\'Jedediah\\' was used in the 1993 Beverly Hillbillies theatrical movie (coincidentally, on Ebsen\\'s subsequent series, Barnaby Jones, Barnaby\\'s nephew J.R. was also named Jedediah). In one episode Jed and Granny reminisce about seeing Buddy Ebsen and Vilma Ebsen—a joking reference to the Ebsens\\' song and dance act. Jed appears in all 274 episodes. GrannyDaisy May Moses (Irene Ryan), called \"Granny\" by all (relatives or not) is Jed\\'s shotgun-toting mother-in-law and a true daughter of Dixie. Paul Henning, the show\\'s creator/producer quickly disposed of the idea of Granny being Jed\\'s mother, which would have changed the show\\'s dynamics, making Granny the matriarch and Jed subordinate to her. Granny can be aggressive but is often overruled by Jed. She is a confederate to the core, defending President Jefferson Davis, the Stars and Bars, and the simple life.  Short-fused and easily angered, Granny fancies herself a \"dunked\" (not \"sprinkled\") Christian with forgiveness in her heart. She abhors \"revenuers\" and blue-coat Yankees. A self-styled \"M.D.\"\\xa0— \"mountain doctor\"\\xa0— she claims to have an edge over expensive know-nothing city physicians. In lieu of anesthesia, Granny uses her \"white lightning\" brew before commencing on painful treatments such as leech bleeding and yanking teeth with pliers.Short and scrappy, Granny often wields a double-barreled, 12-gauge shotgun and fires it numerous times during the run of the show (in a first-season episode she chases Milburn Drysale with it when she found out his family had a feud with her family back in the hills). She fires it once at the front lawn when Jed is witching for water and several times on the skeet shooting range. During the mock Indian invasion she believed she was shooting live shells, though Milburn Drysdale had removed the buckshot to protect the actors portraying the Indians. She fires rock salt and bacon rind at a crow during the \"Happy Valley\" episode, and again at the back of an armored truck in which Milburn Drysdale was taking refuge in.  She fires at (and hits in the posterior) Milburn Drysdale with rocksalt believing he is the ghost of \"Lady Clemintine\" ending their second visit to \"Clampett Castle\" in Kent, England.Granny also fires \"Lady Fingers\" (which Elly had baked for Jethro to take to the Army Reserve) into the posterior of an actor portraying Gen. Ulysses S. Grant during \"The Battle of Culpepper Plantation\"She is also able to tell the precise time via a sun dial and the weather via a beetle (Granny Versus the Weather Bureau). Without her glasses, Granny is extremely nearsighted\\xa0— once in a crossover with the Petticoat Junction show, Granny mistakes a dog for a baby child and a coffee pot for a telephone. Two of Granny\\'s phobias are \"Injuns\" (she actually buys wigs so the Clampetts won\\'t be \"scalped\") and the \"cement pond\" (swimming pool–she has a fear of water). In a long story arc in the show\\'s ninth season, Elly May dates a U.S. Navy frogman, which confuses Granny: After seeing the frogman climb out of the pool in his skin-diving wear, she thinks that anyone who swims in the pool will be turned into a frog. She also has a peculiar way of retelling the War Between The States, in which she thinks the South has won and Jefferson Davis is the president, while calling Sherman\\'s March \"Sherman\\'s Retreat to the Sea\". Any attempts to correct her meet with failure. She is also known for slicing off switches to use on Jethro, mainly whenever he goes too far with his dumb and idiotic schemes.There are references to Granny growing up in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee. From episode 9: \"When I was a girl back in Tennessee, I set so many boys\\' hearts on fire that they took to calling that neck of the woods The Smoky Mountains.\"Granny\\'s full name, Daisy Moses, allegedly an homage to the popular and dearly loved folk artist Anna Mary Robertson, known to the world as Grandma Moses. (Grandma Moses died in 1961, a year before The Beverly Hillbillies made its television debut.) Granny is frequently referred to as \"Granny Clampett\" in a number of episodes but technically she is a Moses. Granny appears in all 274 episodes. Elly May ClampettElly May (Donna Douglas), Jed\\'s only child, is a mountain beauty with the body of a pinup girl and the soul of a tomboy. She can throw a fastball as well as \"rassle\" most men to a fall, and she can be as tender with her friends, animals, and family as she is tough with anyone she rassles. She said once that animals could be better companions than people, but as she grew older she saw that, \"fellas kin be more fun than critters.\" Elly is squired about by eager young Hollywood actors with stage names like \"Dash Riprock\" and \"Bolt Upright.\" Other boyfriends for Elly include Sonny Drysdale, Beau Short, beatnik Sheldon Epps, and Mark Templeton, a frogman.Elly\\'s most notable weakness, oft mentioned when she is being \"courted,\" is her lack of kitchen skills. Family members cringe when, for plot reasons, Elly takes over the kitchen. Rock-like donuts and cookies, for example, are a plot function in an episode featuring Wally Cox as bird watching Professor Biddle.Elly is briefly considered for film stardom at the movie studio owned by Jed. In one episode, hearing Rock Hudson and Cary Grant are both single, Granny asks that Elly be introduced to them.During the final season Elly May takes a job as a secretary at the Commerce Bank after Jed and Granny persuade her that it would be a good way to \"meet a husband.\"In the 1981 TV movie of The Beverly Hillbillies, Elly May is head of a zoo. Elly May appears in all 274 episodes.In addition to the family dog, Duke (an old bloodhound), a number of animals lived on the Clampett estate thanks to animal-lover Elly. These animals were collectively known as her \"critters\". The most prominent pets were chimpanzees, but other animals (from the typical dogs, cats to less-traditional house pets, such as deer, possums, bears, goats, raccoons, kangaroos, etc.) were also occasionally featured. Jethro BodineJethro (Max Baer, Jr.) is the son of Jed\\'s cousin, Pearl Bodine (though he addresses Jed as his uncle). He drove the Clampett family to their new home in California and stayed on with them to further his education. The whole family boasts of Jethro\\'s \"sixth-grade education\" but nevertheless feels he is a bit of an idiot. Jethro is simply naive in the first season of the show but becomes incredibly ignorant and pompous as the series progresses. He often shows off his cyphering abilities with multiplication and \"go-zin-ta\\'s,\" as in \"five gozinta five one times, five gozinta ten two times,\" etc.  The tallest student in his class in the town of Oxford (so named because \"that\\'s where the oxen used to ford the creek\") because of his age, he is often impressing others that he graduated \"top of his class at Oxford.\"  In Beverly Hills, he decides to go to college. He manages to enroll late in the semester at a local secretarial school due to his financial backing and earns his diploma by the end of the day because he did not understand what was going on in class and was too disruptive. This was an ironic in-joke – in real life, Max Baer, Jr, has a bachelor\\'s degree in business administration from Santa Clara University (he also minored in philosophy).Many stories in the series involve Jethro\\'s endless career search, which include such diverse vocations as a millwright, a brain surgeon, street car conductor, double-naught spy, Hollywood producer (a studio flunky remarks Jethro has the right qualifications for being a producer—a sixth-grade education and his uncle owns the studio. The in-joke gag of Jethro as a movie producer was replayed in the 1981 movie), soda jerk, short order cook, and once as a bookkeeper for Milburn Drysdale\\'s bank. More often than not, his overall goal in these endeavors is to obtain as many pretty girls as humanly possible. Of all the Clampett clan, he is the one who makes the most change from \\'country bumpkin\\' to \\'city boy.\\' Another running gag is that Jethro is known as the \"six-foot stomach\" for his ability to eat: in one episode, he eats a jetliner\\'s entire supply of steaks; in another, Jethro tries to set himself up as a Hollywood agent for cousin \"Bessie\" – with a fee of 10,000 bananas for Bessie and 1,000 bananas for Jethro. At one time Jed mentions Jethro was the only baby he knew born with a full set of teeth \"just like a beaver\". Jethro appears in 272 episodes; he is not in the third- or second-to-last episodes, but Baer of course remains billed in the title credits. Baer claimed he only auditioned for the role of Jethro for fun and never expected to get the part. Supposedly, he clinched the part largely because of his grin. The DrysdalesMilburn (Raymond Bailey), Margaret (Harriet E. MacGibbon), and Sonny (Louis Nye): The Drysdales are the Clampetts\\' next-door neighbors. Milburn is the Commerce Bank\\'s tightwad president and the friendly bumpkins\\' confidant. The haughty Mrs. Drysdale touts a heritage that traces back to the Mayflower, but money-hungry Milburn\\'s concerns are strictly monetary. When suffering an anxiety attack, Milburn sniffs a stack of money and is quickly revived. In the interest of keeping the Clampetts\\' account at all costs, Mr. Drysdale is prone to appease them and says that anything they do is unquestionably right. He often forces others, especially his secretary, to placate the Clampetts by granting their unorthodox requests. Although wife Margaret, a blue-blooded Bostonian, has obvious disdain for the \"peasant\" and \"dreadful\" hillbillies, she tacitly agrees to tolerate them (rather than Milburn lose their ever growing account—which is $96,000,000 in 1969, equal to $  today). Margaret loathes all four \"vagabonds,\" but her most heated rivalry is with Granny, with whom she occasionally has some \"scraps.\" Raymond Bailey appears in 247 episodes. Harriet E. MacGibbon appears in 55 episodes between 1962 and 1969, she is not seen in the last two seasons of the show although is occasionally mentioned. Margaret\\'s aged father has gambled away most of their money. Mrs. Drysdale\\'s son—and Milburn\\'s stepson—is Sonny (played by Louis Nye), who is a forty-something collegian who doesn\\'t believe in working up a sweat and is an insufferable mama\\'s boy. Finding Elly May a lovely, naive Pollyanna, he courts her until she literally tosses him. Although the character is fondly remembered by fans, Sonny only appears in four episodes, three in 1962 and a final appearance in 1966. Jane HathawayJane Hathaway (Nancy Kulp), whom the Clampetts addressed as \"Miss Jane\", is Drysdale\\'s loyal and efficient secretarial assistant. Though she always carried out his wishes, she was inherently decent and was frequently put off by her boss\\' greed. When she was annoyed with him, as was often the case, especially when one of Drysdale\\'s schemes went too far, she would usually and forcefully say \"Chief!\". Jane was genuinely fond of the family (to the Clampetts, she was considered family; even Granny, the one most dead-set against living in California, liked her very much); in fact, she actually harbored something of a crush on Jethro for most of the series\\' run. At first, she mistook the Clampetts as the servants, until she realized who they really were (which almost cost her her job). Miss Hathaway frequently has to \"rescue\" Drysdale from his idiotic schemes, receiving little or no thanks for her efforts. In one episode, she and Granny, disguised as \"geisha girls\", finally have enough and \"crown\" Drysdale and Jethro, who have made one too many comments about women serving men. Jane is loyal to Drysdale, as well, despite her misgivings toward his avarice and greed. In one episode, the Clampetts, feeling money has corrupted them, give all of their money to Virginia \"Ginny\" Jennings (Sheila Kuehl), a college student. While Drysdale moans the loss of the money, Jane immediately tells him to stop thinking about the Clampetts and start trying to get the Jennings account. Eventually, everyone discovered Jennings\\' real motives, and she was gone, with the Clampetts getting their money back, and things were as they were before. In one episode, it is established that Miss Jane sacrificed her job as the top secretary of the top executive of the top insurance company to join Mr. Drysdale at the Commerce Bank. Miss Jane was a Vassar graduate. Nancy Kulp appears in 246 episodes. In 1999, TV Guide ranked Jane Hathaway #38 on its \"50 Greatest TV Characters of All Time\" list.  Semiregulars Pearl Bodine Jed\\'s cousin Pearl Bodine, portrayed by Bea Benaderet, was Jethro\\'s widowed mother. In the last season, Granny mentioned that her husband, Fred Bodine, had drowned in a fishing accident when Jethro was just a baby (although, in an earlier episode, Jethro shared some memories of his father with a psychiatrist).  Pearl was a generally well-meaning mother to Jethro. She also was a popular character, often used as a foil for Granny, and became a regular part-way through the first season (the end credits were even refilmed to include Pearl with the other family members). She disappeared after the first year because Benaderet had become the star of another Paul Henning series, Petticoat Junction. Like Elly May, Pearl\\'s name came from that of a character (Pearl Lester) in the popular rural-life novel, play, and film Tobacco Road. Pearl Bodine appears in 22 of the first season\\'s episodes, 1962–63, and later makes a cameo in the 1967 episode \"Greetings From The President\". In the episodes \"The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed\" and \"The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted\" Herbert Rudley plays the psychiatrist Dr. Eugene Twombley. In the episodes Pearl is enamored with Dr. Twombley; Benaderet\\'s real life husband was named Eugene Twombley. The role of Pearl was first offered to Shirley Collie. Jethrine Bodine Jethrine is Pearl\\'s king-sized daughter, Jethro\\'s twin (and is also played by Baer, though voiced by Linda Kaye). Jethrine appears in 11 episodes in 1962–63; she moves with her mother to the Clampett mansion later that season but occasionally is not seen in episodes during her stay in California. Jethrine was upset in leaving the hills as it meant separation from her \"sweetie\", traveling salesman Jazzbo Depew. Late in the season it was explained in an episode that Jethrine had returned home to marry Depew, although the wedding was never seen in the series (nor was Jethrine ever seen again, although she was occasionally referenced). Jethro and Jethrine rarely appeared in the same scene in any of the programs, and then they were never on-camera at the same time except for the rare back-of-the-head shot of one done by a double. Jethrine appears in the 1993 movie version. Dash Riprock Dash, played by Larry Pennell, was the handsome Hollywood actor employed by Jed\\'s movie studio. Elly May and he met while she was working as an extra at the studio. Once Dash saw the beautiful Elly in her bathing suit, he was smitten with her. The two had an on-and-off relationship. In one episode, Mr. Drysdale forced Dash into courting Elly May by threatening to put him in a television show called Crabman. Elly initially liked Dash and enjoyed being with him on dates. Jethro, however, was more enamored with Dash and his playboy persona than was his comely cousin. Riprock was a send-up of the blatantly fake screen names employed by a number of movie actors of the period. Riprock\\'s real name (before being changed by Hollywood moguls) was \"Homer Noodleman,\" and he was from Peoria, Illinois. Dash Riprock was in 10 episodes, mainly between 1965–69. Lowell Redlings Farquhar Lowell is the elderly father of Mrs. Drysdale; Granny considers him a potential beau. Lowell (played by Charles Ruggles) is in three episodes, 1965–66. Lester Flatt and Earl Scruggs Country music stars Flatt and Scruggs (who play themselves in seven episodes, 1963–68) are longtime friends of the Clampetts \"back home\" (Kimberling City, Missouri) who visit with the Clampetts when they are on tour in California. The duo had a number-one Billboard country single with the show\\'s \"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\" (although the song is actually performed in the credits by Jerry Scoggins to Flatt and Scruggs\\' instrumental). Actress Joi Lansing played Flatt\\'s wife, Gladys, in five episodes, 1963–68. John Brewster Brewster (played by Frank Wilcox), is the President and CEO of the OK Oil Company, headquartered in Tulsa, who purchases the oil rights to the gusher on the Clampett home back in the hills. The Clampetts are quite fond of him, and his wife occasionally visits them in California. John Brewster appears in 14 episodes, 1962–1966. Janet Trego Janet (played by Sharon Tate) is a beautiful secretary at the Commerce Bank. Although Janet appears in 15 episodes, 1963–65, her role is generally quite minor. Tate was later murdered by Charles Manson\\'s \"family\" just before the start of the eighth season. Sam Drucker Sam (played by Frank Cady) owns the general store in Hooterville. Granny is constantly under the impression Sam wants to marry her, but Sam has no intentions of doing so. He appears in 10 episodes between 1968 and 1970. Cady also starred as Sam Drucker in Petticoat Junction and Green Acres. Cady reprised the role of Sam Drucker for the 1990 Green Acres reunion movie Return to Green Acres. Helen Thompson Helen (played by Danielle Mardi) is a beautiful British secretary at the Commerce Bank. Helen takes over Jane Hathaway\\'s job as Mr. Drysdale\\'s secretary after Ms. Hathaway resigned. Helen appears in 17 episodes between 1969 and 1971. She was one of the ringleaders of the protest group the secretaries of the Commerce Bank created, GRUN (Girls Resist Unfair Neglect). She, along with many other secretaries, as well as Elly and Granny, lived with Ms. Hathaway for a short time in her apartment. Shorty Kellums Shorty (played by Shug Fisher) is Jed\\'s longtime buddy from back home, with whom Jed reunites in 1969 when the Clampetts go back for an extended period to the Hills. Shorty is a wiry little man who is crazy about voluptuous girls half his age. Shorty later moves into the Clampett mansion in Beverly Hills for a period. Shorty Kellums appears in 17 episodes in the 1969–70 season, and returned again briefly during 1970–71. Elverna Bradshaw Elverna is Granny\\'s longtime rival back in the Hills, a gossip second to none. She makes a brief appearance in a 1963 episode when the Clampetts go back to the Hills to fetch Pearl to California, but is not seen again until 1969, when the Clampetts return to their native land for an extended visit. However, both Granny and Jed referred to the character in several episodes throughout the series\\' run. Elverna (played by Elvia Allman) and Granny rekindle their feud in a match to see who will be first wed, Elverna\\'s daughter or Elly May. For reasons not really explained, Elverna also moves into the Clampett Beverly Hills mansion during the same period Shorty does; both of them, however, are gone from the estate for the final 1970–71 season, presumably having returned home. Elverna Bradshaw appears in 13 episodes, 1963–1970. Matthew and Mark Templeton The Templetons are two brothers, both played by actor Roger Torrey, who originally auditioned (unsuccessfully) for the part of Jethro. Matthew is seen in three episodes in October 1969 during the Clampetts\\' stay in the Hills, where Granny tags the preacherman as a prospective husband for Elly. Unfortunately, Granny learns Matthew is married. Just a year later back in California, Elly meets Matthew\\'s brother, Mark Templeton, who is a marine biologist, a frogman, whom Granny believes is actually part frog. The Mark Templeton storyline played out for nine episodes and was abruptly dropped, although advance publicity for the show indicated Elly May and Mark would be marrying during the season; however, the show was cancelled at the end of that season as part of the CBS Rural Purge. StorylinesMost episodes revolved around the clash between the \"uncivilized\" hillbilly culture represented by the Clampetts and the high society American culture of the Drysdales. The Clampetts lived as they always had, even in their large, elegant mansion, never abandoning their mountain attire or replacing the old rattletrap truck in which they had moved to California. Although when asked what kind of truck it is, Jethro said \\'I think it\\'s a Stutz\\', it is actually based on a 1921 Oldsmobile. All the Hillbillies were handy with firearms and always seemed to have their weapons close at hand and ready to draw. They continued to grow their own food, and Granny made lye soap and moonshine. The extreme potency of the moonshine liquor and the harshness of the lye soap were running gags throughout the run of the series.As another running joke, the movie theaters back in the hills were still showing films from the silent movie era and the Hillbillies were unaware of talking pictures or more contemporary movie stars. Granny\\'s favorite actor was Hoot Gibson, but she also had an intense crush on William S. Hart, and the whole Clampett family adored Mary Pickford. Silent movie legend Gloria Swanson made a memorable guest appearance on the show as herself in an episode that featured a comic parody of a silent melodrama. The Clampetts did, however, have a television, on which they watched soap operas and \"rasslin\\'\", as well as John Wayne movies, as he was apparently one of the few \"talkie\" movie stars of whom they were aware. Wayne made a brief cameo as himself after the Clampett mansion was \"attacked\" by stuntmen dressed as Native Americans.Pearl and Granny often fought for kitchen supremacy. Pearl once told Granny \"a blood cousin trumps a mother-in-law\". This underscored a familial disconnect between Jethro and Granny; although they shared no bloodlines, Jethro still called her \"Granny\" (as did everyone else on the show, including Miss Jane and the Drysdales). Other than their kitchen wars, relations between Granny and Pearl were generally friendly. The second season began with a brief mention of Pearl having moved back to the hills, an ironic departure, as it was Pearl who had urged Jed to move to California. The change came about because actress Bea Benaderet had left the show to star in Petticoat Junction. Mrs. Drysdale soon became Granny\\'s main sparring partner.Although both Douglas and Baer were well into their twenties when the series started, during the first years of the series, their characters were supposed to be teenagers. Elly May was enrolled in an elite girls\\' school in the first season, although no further mention was made of her education in later episodes. Jethro was enrolled in a sixth-grade class with much younger students; a few episodes later on, the scripts suggested that he was still in school.Should Granny or one of her kin feel lonely for the hills, banker Drysdale would bend over backwards to placate the offended subject. Drysdale went so far as to recreate the log cabin the Clampetts had lived in and place it right next to the \"cee-ment pond\" and the still Granny had installed to make moonshine. Another time Drysdale followed the Clampetts to the \"Hills\" and bought up the Silver Dollar City \"bank\" just to make sure he had a controlling interest in the Clampetts\\' money. One running gag was that when Jed would take money out of his pocket, Drysdale\\'s blood pressure would go up. A similar running joke was that when it seemed the Clampetts would take their money out of his bank, Drysdale\\'s face would turn green. A variation of the joke of Drysdale\\'s face changing color is in one episode when, after being given some of Granny\\'s \"Tennessee Tranquilizer\" (moonshine), Drysdale\\'s face turns red.Another frequent source of humor dealt with Jethro\\'s endless career search, which included such diverse vocations as soda jerk, brain surgeon, Hollywood celebrity, and secret \"double naught\" agent/spy. Jethro coveted movie star fame and relished becoming a \"playboy\" like Elly\\'s beau Dash Riprock. Jethro\\'s stupidity usually caused such career attempts to fail spectacularly, as when he decided to open a \"topless\" restaurant (\"The Happy Gizzard\"), where the waiters and waitresses were hatless. The one time in the series when Jethro almost succeeded as a \"Hollywood celebrity\" was when \"Cousin Roy\" (Roy Clark) tried to get Jethro to back him up as a country singer in Hollywood; Jethro refused and failed as usual. Jethro did have one success, of sorts. When he rescued a Bird Watchers girl troop who fell into the \"cement pond\" (they were attacked by ants), Jethro got a \"lifesaving badge\".Misunderstandings were a general source of humor in the program, such as when the Clampetts did not understand something they had never encountered before (such as a water faucet), or when various city dwellers could not comprehend something the Clampetts were talking about. A group of businessmen overheard Jed talking about \"crawdads\" and concluded he was discussing a new type of military vehicle, in which they wanted to invest. Conversely, when Jed muses to Mr. Brewster about whether he can afford to move to Beverly Hills, Brewster responds with, \"Why, Mr. Clampett, with your money, you could afford the Taj Mahal\", to which Jed rejoins, \"I\\'ll take it!\" When Brewster insists he was making a joke; Jed allows that he can go right ahead. Brewster: \"Well, that was the joke.\" Jed: \"Mr. Brewster, you\\'re an awfully nice feller, but I\\'ve heard a sight better jokes than that!\"The Clampetts went back to the hills for Christmas during the first season, but did not return there until the eighth season, during which several episodes were filmed on location in Kimberling City, Missouri. During this period, Shug Fisher and Elvia Allman joined the cast as Shorty and Elverna (Allman had appeared on an episode in the first season playing the same character).One constant throughout the series was that the Hillbillies, who were scrupulously honest, were surrounded by cynical, conniving and money-hungry \"city-folk\", whose plans were always foiled (usually unknowingly) by the Clampetts. Reunions 1981 CBS TV movieIn 1981, a Return of the Beverly Hillbillies television movie, written and produced by series creator Paul Henning, was aired on the CBS network. Irene Ryan had died in 1973, and Raymond Bailey had died in 1980. The script acknowledged Granny\\'s passing but featured Imogene Coca as Granny\\'s mother. Max Baer decided against reprising the role that both started and stymied his career, so the character of Jethro Bodine was given to another actor, Ray Young.The film\\'s plot had Jed back in his old homestead in Bug Tussle, having divided his massive fortune among Elly May and Jethro, both of whom stayed on the West Coast. Jane Hathaway had become a Department of Energy agent and was seeking Granny\\'s \"White Lightnin\\'\" recipe to combat the energy crisis. Since Granny had gone on to \"her re-ward\", it was up to Granny\\'s centenarian \"Maw\" (Imogene Coca) to divulge the secret brew\\'s ingredients. Subplots included Jethro playing an egocentric, starlet-starved Hollywood producer, Jane and her boss (Werner Klemperer) having a romance and Elly May owning a large petting zoo. The four main characters finally got together by the end of the story.Having been filmed a mere decade after the final episode of the original series, viewer consensus was that the series\\' original spirit was lost to the film on many fronts, chief of which being the deaths of Ryan and Bailey and Baer\\'s absence, which left only three of the six original cast members available to reprise their respective roles. Further subtracting from the familiarity was the fact that the legendary Clampett mansion was unavailable for a location shoot as the owners\\' lease was too expensive. Henning himself admitted sheer embarrassment when the finished product aired, blaming his inability to rewrite the script due to the 1981 Writers Guild strike.  1993 television specialIn 1993, Ebsen, Douglas, and Baer reunited onscreen for the only time in the CBS-TV retrospective television special, The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies which ranked as the fourth most watched television program of the week—a major surprise given the mediocre rating for the 1981 TV-movie. It was a rare tribute from the \"Tiffany network\", which owed much of its success in the 1960s to the series, but has often seemed embarrassed by it in hindsight, often down-playing the show in retrospective television specials on the network\\'s history and rarely inviting cast members to participate in such all-star broadcasts.The Legend of The Beverly Hillbillies special ignored several plot twists of the TV movie, notably Jethro was now not a film director but a leading Los Angeles physician. Critter-loving Elly May was still in California with her animals, but Jed was back home in the Hills, having lost his fortune, stolen by the now-imprisoned banker Drysdale. Nancy Kulp had died in 1991 and was little referred to beyond the multitude of film clips that dotted the special. The special was released on VHS tape by CBS/Fox Video in 1995 and as a bonus feature on the Official Third Season DVD Set in 2009. Reruns and syndicationThe Beverly Hillbillies is still televised daily around the world in syndication. In the United States, the show is broadcast on TV Land and MeTV and was previously on WGN America.  A limited number of episodes from the earlier portions of the series run have turned up in the public domain and as such are seen occasionally on many smaller networks.The show is distributed by CBS Television Distribution, the syndication arm of CBS Television Studios and the CBS network. It was previously distributed by CBS Films, Viacom Enterprises, Paramount Domestic Television, and CBS Paramount Domestic Television (all through corporate changes involving TV distribution rights to the early CBS library). The repeats of the show that debuted on CBS Daytime on September 5–9, 1966 as \"Mornin\\' Beverly Hillbillies\" through September 10, 1971 and on September 13–17, 1971 as \"The Beverly HILLBILLIES\" lasted up to Winter 1971–1972. It aired at 11:00–11:30am Eastern/10:00-10:30am Central through September 3, 1971, then moved to 10:30–11:00am Eastern/9:30-10:00am Central for the last season on CBS Daytime. Media Fifty-five episodes of the series are in the public domain, (all 36 season-one episodes and 19 season-two episodes), because Orion Television, successor to Filmways, neglected to renew their copyrights. As a result, these episodes have been released on home video and DVD on many low-budget labels and shown on low-power television stations and low-budget networks in   prints. In many video prints of the public domain episodes, the original theme music has been replaced by generic music due to copyright issues.Before his death, Paul Henning, whose estate now holds the original film elements to the public domain episodes, authorized MPI Home Video to release the best of the first two seasons on DVD, the first \"ultimate collection\" of which was released in the fall of 2005. These collections include the original, uncut versions of the first season\\'s episodes, complete with their original theme music and opening sponsor plugs. Volume 1 has, among its bonus features, the alternate, unaired version of the pilot film, The Hillbillies Of Beverly Hills (the version of the episode that sold the series to CBS), and the \"cast commercials\" (cast members pitching the products of the show\\'s sponsors) originally shown at the end of each episode. DVD name  No. of episodes Release dates  Region 1  The Ultimate Collection, Volume 1 26 September 27, 2005  With the exception of the public domain episodes, the copyrights to the series were renewed by Orion Television.  However, any new compilation of Hillbillies material will be copyrighted by either MPI Media Group or CBS, depending on the content of the material used.  The trademarks, concepts, and character rights are the exclusive property of CBS Broadcasting. For many years, 20th Century Fox, through a joint venture with CBS called CBS/Fox Video, released select episodes of Hillbillies on videocassette. After Viacom merged with CBS, Paramount Home Entertainment (the video division of Paramount Pictures, which was acquired by Viacom in 1994) took over the video rights.In 2006, Paramount announced plans to release the copyrighted episodes in boxed sets through CBS DVD later that year. The show\\'s second season (consisting of the public domain episodes from that season) was released on DVD in Region 1 on October 7, 2008 as \"...The Official Second Season\".

Origin and historical locations Early namesake  The Alexander Graham Bell Laboratory, also variously known as the Volta Bureau, the Bell Carriage House, the Bell Laboratory and the Volta Laboratory, was created in Washington, D.C. by Alexander Graham Bell.In 1880, the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs (approximately US$10,000 at that time, about $  in current dollars ) for the invention of the telephone, which he used to found the Volta Laboratory, along with Sumner Tainter and Bell\\'s cousin Chichester Bell. Bruce, Robert V. Bell: Alexander Bell and the Conquest of Solitude. Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1990. ISBN 0-8014-9691-8.  His research laboratory focused on the analysis, recording and transmission of sound. Bell used his considerable profits from the laboratory for further research and education to permit the \"[increased] diffusion of knowledge relating to the deaf\".  The Volta Laboratory and the Volta Bureau were earlier located at Bell\\'s father\\'s house at 1527 35th Street in Washington, D.C., where its carriage house became their headquarters in 1889.  In 1893, Bell constructed a new building (close by at 1537 35th St.) specifically to house it.  The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1972.       and       Early antecedent In 1884 the American Bell Telephone Company created its Mechanical Department from the Electrical and Patent Department formed a year earlier. Formal organizationIn 1925 Western Electric Research Laboratories and part of the engineering department of the American Telephone & Telegraph company (AT&T) were consolidated to form Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc., as a separate entity. The first president of research was Frank B. Jewett, who stayed there until 1940. The ownership of Bell Laboratories was evenly split between AT&T and the Western Electric Company. Its principal work was to design and support the equipment that Western Electric built for Bell System operating companies, including telephone exchange switches. Support work for the phone companies included the writing and maintaining of the Bell System Practices (BSP), a comprehensive series of technical manuals. Bell Labs also carried out consulting work for the Bell Telephone Companies, and U.S. government work, including Project Nike and the Apollo program. A few workers were assigned to basic research, and this attracted much attention, especially since they produced several Nobel Prize winners. Until the 1940s, the company\\'s principal locations were in and around the Bell Labs Building in New York City, but many of these were moved to suburban areas of New Jersey.Among the later Bell Laboratories locations in New Jersey were Murray Hill, Holmdel, Crawford Hill, the Deal Test Site, Freehold, Lincroft, Long Branch, Middletown, Neptune, Princeton, Piscataway, Red Bank, and Whippany. Of these, Murray Hill and Crawford Hill remain in existence (the Piscataway and Red Bank locations were transferred to and are now operated by Telcordia Technologies and the Whippany site was purchased by Bayer ). The largest grouping of people in the company was in Illinois, at Naperville-Lisle, in the Chicago area, which had the largest concentration of employees (about 11,000) prior to 2001. There also were groups of employees in Indianapolis, Indiana; Columbus, Ohio; North Andover, Massachusetts; Allentown, Pennsylvania; Reading, Pennsylvania; and Breinigsville, Pennsylvania; Burlington, North Carolina (1950s–1970s, moved to Greensboro 1980s) and Westminster, Colorado. Since 2001, many of the former locations have been scaled down, or shut down entirely. Discoveries and developmentsAt its peak, Bell Laboratories was the premier facility of its type, developing a wide range of revolutionary technologies, including radio astronomy, the transistor, the laser, information theory, the UNIX operating system, the C programming language and the C++ programming language. Seven Nobel Prizes have been awarded for work completed at Bell Laboratories.  1937: Clinton J. Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for demonstrating the wave nature of matter. 1956: John Bardeen, Walter H. Brattain, and William Shockley received the Nobel Prize in Physics for inventing the first transistors. 1977: Philip W. Anderson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing an improved understanding of the electronic structure of glass and magnetic materials. 1978: Arno A. Penzias and Robert W. Wilson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics. Penzias and Wilson were cited for their discovery of cosmic microwave background radiation, a nearly uniform glow that fills the Universe in the microwave band of the radio spectrum. 1997: Steven Chu shared the Nobel Prize in Physics for developing methods to cool and trap atoms with laser light. 1998: Horst Stormer, Robert Laughlin, and Daniel Tsui, were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery and explanation of the fractional quantum Hall effect. 2009: Willard S. Boyle, George E. Smith shared the Nobel Prize in Physics together with Charles K. Kao. Boyle and Smith were cited for the invention of charge-coupled device (CCD) semiconductor imaging sensors. The Turing Award has twice been won by Bell Labs researchers: 1968: Richard Hamming for his work on numerical methods, automatic coding systems, and error-detecting and error-correcting codes. 1983: Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie for their work on operating systems theory, and their development of Unix. 1920sDuring its first year of operation, facsimile (fax) transmission, invented elsewhere, was first demonstrated publicly by the Bell Laboratories.  In 1926, the laboratories invented an early example synchronous-sound motion picture system, in competition with Fox Movietone and DeForest Phonofilm. In 1924, Bell Labs physicist Dr. Walter A. Shewhart proposed the control chart as a method to determine when a process was in a state of statistical control. Shewart\\'s methods were the basis for statistical process control (SPC)\\xa0— the use of statistically based tools and techniques for the management and improvement of processes. This was the origin of the modern quality movement, including Six Sigma.In 1927, a Bell team headed by Herbert E. Ives successfully transmitted long-distance 128-line television images of Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover from Washington to New York. In 1928 the thermal noise in a resistor was first measured by John B. Johnson, and Harry Nyquist provided the theoretical analysis. (This is now referred to as \"Johnson noise\".) During the 1920s, the one-time pad cipher was invented by Gilbert Vernam and Joseph Mauborgne at the laboratories. Bell Labs\\' Claude Shannon later proved that it is unbreakable. 1930sIn 1931, a foundation for radio astronomy was laid by Karl Jansky during his work investigating the origins of static on long-distance shortwave communications. He discovered that radio waves were being emitted from the center of the galaxy.  In 1931 and 1932, experimental high fidelity, long playing, and even stereophonic recordings were made by the labs of the Philadelphia Orchestra, conducted by Leopold Stokowski.   In 1933, stereo signals were transmitted live from Philadelphia to Washington, D.C. In 1937, the vocoder, the first electronic speech synthesizer was invented and demonstrated by Homer Dudley. Bell researcher Clinton Davisson shared the Nobel Prize in Physics with George Paget Thomson for the discovery of electron diffraction, which helped lay the foundation for solid-state electronics. 1940sIn the early 1940s, the photovoltaic cell was developed by Russell Ohl. In 1943, Bell developed SIGSALY, the first digital scrambled speech transmission system, used by the Allies in World War II. Bell Labs Quality Assurance Department gave the world and the United States such statisticians as Walter A. Shewhart, W. Edwards Deming, Harold F. Dodge, George Edwards, Harry Romig, R. L. Jones, Paul Olmstead, E.G.D. Paterson, and Mary N. Torrey. During World War II, Emergency Technical Committee - Quality Control, drawn mainly from Bell Labs\\' statisticians, was instrumental in advancing Army and Navy ammunition acceptance and material sampling procedures.In 1947, the transistor, probably the most important invention developed by Bell Laboratories, was invented by John Bardeen, Walter Houser Brattain, and William Bradford Shockley (and who subsequently shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1956). In 1947, Richard Hamming invented Hamming codes for error detection and correction. For patent reasons, the result was not published until 1950. In 1948, \"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\", one of the founding works in information theory, was published by Claude Shannon in the Bell System Technical Journal. It built in part on earlier work in the field by Bell researchers Harry Nyquist and Ralph Hartley, but it greatly extended these. Bell Labs also introduced a series of increasingly complex calculators through the decade. Shannon was also the founder of modern cryptography with his 1949 paper Communication Theory of Secrecy Systems. Calculators Model I: A Complex Number Calculator, completed January 1940, for doing calculations of complex numbers. See George Stibitz. Model II: Relay Calculator or Relay Interpolator, September 1943, for aiming anti-aircraft guns Model III: Ballistic Computer, June 1944, for calculations of ballistic trajectories Model IV: Bell Laboratories Relay Calculator, March 1945, a second Ballistic Computer Model V: Bell Laboratories General Purpose Relay Calculator, of which two were built, July 1946 and February 1947, which were general-purpose programmable computers using electromechanical relay Model VI: November 1950, an enhanced Model V 1950sIn 1952 William Gardner Pfann revealed the method of zone melting which enabled semiconductor purification and level doping.The 1950s also saw developmental activity based upon information theory. The central development was binary code systems. Efforts concentrated more precisely on the Laboratories\\' prime mission of supporting the Bell System with engineering advances including N-carrier, TD Microwave radio relay, Direct Distance Dialing, E-repeaters, Wire spring relays, and improved switching systems. Maurice Karnaugh, in 1953, developed the Karnaugh map as a tool to facilitate management of Boolean algebraic expressions. In 1954, The first modern solar cell was invented at Bell Laboratories. As for the spectacular side of the business, in 1956 TAT-1, the first transatlantic telephone cable was laid between Scotland and Newfoundland, in a joint effort by AT&T, Bell Laboratories, and British and Canadian telephone companies.  A year later, in 1957, MUSIC, one of the first computer programs to play electronic music, was created by Max Mathews. New greedy algorithms developed by Robert C. Prim and Joseph Kruskal, revolutionized computer network design. In 1958, the laser was first described, in a technical paper by Arthur Schawlow and Charles Hard Townes. 1960sIn December 1960, Ali Javan and his associates William Bennett and Donald Heriot successfully operated the first gas laser, the first continuous-light laser, operating at an unprecedented accuracy and color purity. Also in 1960, Dawon Kahng and Martin Atalla invented the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET); the MOSFET has achieved electronic hegemony and sustains the large-scale integrated circuits (LSIs) underlying today\\'s information society. In 1962, the electret microphone was invented by Gerhard M. Sessler and James Edward Maceo West. In 1964, the Carbon dioxide laser was invented by Kumar Patel. In 1965, Penzias and Wilson discovered the Cosmic Microwave Background, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978. Frank W. Sinden, Edward E. Zajac, Kenneth C. Knowlton, and A. Michael Noll made computer-animated movies during the early to mid-1960s. The first digital computer art was created in 1962 by Noll. In 1966, Orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM), a key technology in wireless services, was developed and patented by R. W. Chang. In 1968, Molecular beam epitaxy was developed by J.R. Arthur and A.Y. Cho; molecular beam epitaxy allows semiconductor chips and laser matrices to be manufactured one atomic layer at a time. In 1969, the UNIX operating system was created by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson. From 1969 to 1971, Aaron Marcus, the first graphic designer in the world to work with computer graphics, researched, designed, and programmed a prototype interactive page-layout system for the Picturephone (TM). The Charge-coupled device (CCD) was invented in 1969 by Willard Boyle and George E. Smith, for which they were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2009. In the 1960s, the New York City site was sold and became the Westbeth Artists Community complex. 1970sThe 1970s and 1980s saw more and more computer-related inventions at the Bell Laboratories as part of the personal computing revolution. In 1972 Dennis Ritchie developed the compiled C programming language as a replacement for the interpretive B which was then used in rewriting the UNIX operating system (also developed at Bell Laboratories by Ritchie and Ken Thompson).  Additionally, the AWK programming language was designed and implemented by Alfred Aho, Peter Weinberger, and Brian Kernighan of Bell Laboratories.In 1970, A. Michael Noll patented a tactile, force-feedback system, coupled with interactive stereoscopic computer display. In 1971, an improved task priority system for computerized switching systems for telephone traffic was invented by Erna Schneider Hoover, who received one of the first software patents for it. In 1976, Fiber optics systems were first tested in Georgia and in 1980, the first single-chip 32-bit microprocessor, the BELLMAC-32A was demonstrated. It went into production in 1982.The 1970s also saw a major central office technology evolve from crossbar electromechanical relay-based technology and discrete transistor logic to Bell Labs-developed thick film hybrid and transistor-transistor logic (TTL), stored program-controlled switching systems; 1A/ Electronic Switching Systems (ESS) and 2A Local Central Offices produced at the Bell Labs Naperville and Western Electric Lisle, Illinois facilities. This technology evolution dramatically reduced the floor space required. The new ESS also came with its own diagnostic software that required only a switchman and several frame technicians to maintain. The technology was often touted in the Bell Labs Technical Journals and Western Electric magazine (WE People).   1980sIn 1980, the TDMA and CDMA digital cellular telephone technology was patented. In 1982, Fractional quantum Hall effect was discovered by Horst Störmer and former Bell Laboratories researchers Robert B. Laughlin and Daniel C. Tsui; they consequently won a Nobel Prize in 1998 for the discovery. In 1986, the C++ programming language was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension to the original C programming language also developed at Bell Laboratories.In 1984, the first photoconductive antennas for picosecond electromagnetic radiation were demonstrated by Auston and others. This type of antenna became an important component in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. In 1984, the Karmarkar Linear Programming Algorithm was developed by mathematician Narendra Karmarkar. Also in 1984, a divestiture agreement signed in 1982 with the American Federal government forced the break-up of AT&T: Bellcore (now Telcordia Technologies) was split off from Bell Laboratories to provide the same R&D functions for the newly created local exchange carriers. AT&T also was limited to using the Bell trademark only in association with Bell Laboratories. Bell Telephone Laboratories, Inc. became a wholly owned company of the new AT&T Technologies unit, the former Western Electric. The 5ESS Switch was developed during this transition. In 1985, laser cooling was used to slow and manipulate atoms by Steven Chu and team. In 1985, the AMPL modeling language was developed by Robert Fourer, David M. Gay and Brian Kernighan at Bell Laboratories.  Also in 1985, Bell Laboratories was awarded the National Medal of Technology \"For contribution over decades to modern communication systems\". During the 1980s, the Plan 9 operating system was developed as a replacement for Unix which was also developed at Bell Laboratories in 1969. Development of the Radiodrum, a three dimensional electronic instrument . In 1988, TAT-8 became the first fiber optic transatlantic cable. 1990s In 1990, WaveLAN, the first wireless local area network (WLAN) was developed at Bell Laboratories. In 1991, the 56K modem technology was patented by Nuri Dağdeviren and his team. In 1994, the quantum cascade laser was invented by Federico Capasso, Alfred Cho, Jerome Faist and their collaborators and was later greatly improved by the innovations of Claire Gmachl. Also in 1994, Peter Shor devised his quantum factorization algorithm. In 1996, SCALPEL electron lithography, which prints features atoms wide on microchips, was invented by Lloyd Harriott and his team. The Inferno operating system, an update of Plan 9, was created by Dennis Ritchie with others, using the new concurrent Limbo programming language. A high performance database engine (Dali) was developed which became DataBlitz in its product form. AT&T spun off Bell Laboratories, along with most of its equipment-manufacturing business, into a new company named Lucent Technologies. AT&T retained a smaller number of researchers, who made up the staff of the newly created AT&T Labs. In 1997, the smallest practical transistor (60 nanometers, 182 atoms wide) was built. In 1998, the first optical router was invented  . 2000s 2000 was an active year for the Laboratories, in which DNA machine prototypes were developed; progressive geometry compression algorithm made widespread 3-D communication practical; the first electrically powered organic laser invented; a large-scale map of cosmic dark matter was compiled, and the F-15 (material), an organic material that makes plastic transistors possible, was invented. In 2002, physicist Jan Hendrik Schön was fired after his work was found to contain fraudulent data. It was the first known case of fraud at Bell Labs.In 2003, the New Jersey Institute of Technology Biomedical Engineering Laboratory was created at Murray Hill, New Jersey. In 2005, Dr. Jeong Kim, former President of Lucent\\'s Optical Network Group, returned from academia to become the President of Bell Laboratories.In April 2006, Bell Laboratories\\' parent company, Lucent Technologies, signed a merger agreement with Alcatel. On December 1, 2006, the merged company, Alcatel-Lucent, began operations. This deal raised concerns in the United States, where Bell Laboratories works on defense contracts. A separate company, LGS Innovations, with an American board was set up to manage Bell Laboratories\\' and Lucent\\'s sensitive U.S. Government contracts.In December 2007, it was announced that the former Lucent Bell Laboratories and the former Alcatel Research and Innovation would be merged into one organization under the name of Bell Laboratories. This is the first period of growth following many years during which Bell Laboratories progressively lost manpower due to layoffs and spin-offs making the company shut down for a short period of time.As of July 2008, however, only four scientists remained in physics basic research, according to a report by the scientific journal Nature. On August 28, 2008, Alcatel-Lucent announced it was pulling out of basic science, material physics, and semiconductor research, and it will instead focus on more immediately marketable areas, including networking, high-speed electronics, wireless networks, nanotechnology and software.

Video interview by Dave Iverson, KQED Public Radio, San Francisco. Hosted by BookTV.org.',6001: \"Geography of Comoros     The Comoros archipelago consists of four main islands aligned along a northwest-southeast axis at the north end of the Mozambique Channel, between Mozambique and the island of Madagascar. Still widely known by their French names, the islands officially have been called by their Swahili names by the Comorian government. They are Grande Comore (Njazidja), Mohéli (Mwali), Anjouan (Nzwani), and Mayotte (Mahoré). The islands' distance from each other—Grande Comore is some 200 kilometers from Mayotte, forty kilometers from Mohéli, and eighty kilometers from Grande Comore—along with a lack of good harbor facilities, make transportation and communication difficult. The islands have a total land area of 2,236 square kilometers (including Mayotte), and claim territorial waters of 320 square kilometers. Mount Karthala (2316 m) on Grande Comore is an active volcano.  From April 17 to 19, 2005, the volcano began spewing ash and gas, forcing as many as 10,000 people to flee.Geographic coordinates:   Grande ComoreGrande Comore is the largest island, sixty-seven kilometers long and twenty-seven kilometers wide, with a total area of 1,146 square kilometers. The most recently formed of the four islands in the archipelago, it is also of volcanic origin. Two volcanoes form the island's most prominent topographic features: La Grille in the north, with an elevation of 1,000 meters, is extinct and largely eroded; Kartala in the south, rising to a height of 2,361 meters, last erupted in 1977. A plateau averaging 600 to 700 meters high connects the two mountains. Because Grande Comore is geologically a relatively new island, its soil is thin and rocky and cannot hold water. As a result, water from the island's heavy rainfall must be stored in catchment tanks. There are no coral reefs along the coast, and the island lacks a good harbor for ships. One of the largest remnants of Comoros' once-extensive rain forests is on the slopes of Kartala. The national capital has been at Moroni since 1962. AnjouanAnjouan, triangular shaped and forty kilometers from apex to base, has an area of 424 square kilometers. Three mountain chains—Sima, Nioumakele, and Jimilime—emanate from a central peak, Mtingui (1,575 m), giving the island its distinctive shape. Older than Grande Comore, Anjouan has deeper soil cover, but overcultivation has caused serious erosion. A coral reef lies close to shore; the island's capital of Mutsamudu is also its main port. MohéliMohéli is thirty kilometers long and twelve kilometers wide, with an area of 290 square kilometers. It is the smallest of the four islands and has a central mountain chain reaching 860 meters at its highest. Like Grande Comore, it retains stands of rain forest. Mohéli's capital is Fomboni. MayotteMayotte, geologically the oldest of the four islands, is thirty-nine kilometers long and twenty-two kilometers wide, totaling 375 square kilometers, and its highest points are between 500 and 600 meters above sea level. Because of greater weathering of the volcanic rock, the soil is relatively rich in some areas. A well-developed coral reef that encircles much of the island ensures protection for ships and a habitat for fish. Dzaoudzi, capital of Comoros until 1962 and now Mayotte's administrative center, is situated on a rocky outcropping off the east shore of the main island. Dzaoudzi is linked by a causeway to le Pamanzi, which at ten kilometers in area is the largest of several islets adjacent to Mayotte. Islets are also scattered in the coastal waters of Grande Comore, Anjouan, and Mohéli. Flora and faunaComorian waters are the habitat of the coelacanth, a rare fish with limblike fins and a cartilaginous skeleton, the fossil remains of which date as far back as 400 million years and which was once thought to have become extinct about 70 million years ago.  A live specimen was caught in 1938 off southern Africa; other coelacanths have since been found in the vicinity of the Comoro Islands.Several mammals are unique to the islands themselves.  Livingstone's fruit bat, although plentiful when discovered by explorer David Livingstone in 1863, has been reduced to a population of about 120, entirely on Anjouan.  The world's largest bat, the jet-black Livingstone fruit bat has a wingspan of nearly two meters.  A British preservation group sent an expedition to Comoros in 1992 to bring some of the bats to Britain to establish a breeding population.A hybrid of the common brown lemur (Eulemur fulvus) originally from Madagascar, was introduced prior by humans prior to European colonization and is found on Mayotte.   The mongoose lemur (Eulemur mongoz), also introduced from Madagascar by humans, can be found on the islands of Mohéli and Anjouan. 22 species of bird are unique to the archipelago and 17 of these are restricted to the Union of the Comoros. These include the Karthala Scops-owl, Anjouan Scops-owl and Humblot's Flycatcher. Partly in response to international pressures, Comorians in the 1990s have become more concerned about the environment.  Steps are being taken not only to preserve the rare fauna, but also to counteract degradation of the environment, especially on densely populated Anjouan.  Specifically, to minimize the cutting down of trees for fuel, kerosene is being subsidized, and efforts are being made to replace the loss of the forest cover caused by ylang-ylang distillation for perfume.  The Community Development Support Fund, sponsored by the International Development Association (IDA, a World Bank affiliate) and the Comorian government, is working to improve water supply on the islands as well. Climate The climate is marine tropical, with two seasons: hot and humid from November to April, the result of the northeastern monsoon, and a cooler, drier season the rest of the year. Average monthly temperatures range from   along the coasts. Although the average annual precipitation is  , water is a scarce commodity in many parts of Comoros. Mohéli and Mayotte possess streams and other natural sources of water, but Grande Comore and Anjouan, whose mountainous landscapes retain water poorly, are almost devoid of naturally occurring running water. Cyclones, occurring during the hot and wet season, can cause extensive damage, especially in coastal areas. On the average, at least twice each decade houses, farms, and harbor facilities are devastated by these great storms. Extreme points This is a list of the extreme points of Comoros, the points that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location. This list excludes the French-administered island of Mayotte which is claimed by the Comorian government.

It is located in the modern Turkish province of Çanakkale. The site sprawls over an estimated  ; among the few structures remaining today are a ruined bath, an odeon, a theatre and gymnasium complex John Freely (2003). The Aegean Coast of Turkey. Redhouse Press, Istanbul, pp.3-8.  and a recently uncovered stadium.   The circuit of the old walls can still be traced. History HellenisticAccording to Strabo, this site was first called Sigeia;  around 306 BC Antigonus refounded the city as the much-expanded Antigonia Troas by settling the people of five other towns in Sigeia, Jona Lendering (2006). Alexandria in Troas (from Livius.org). Retrieved 2010-4-15.  including the once influential city of Neandria. Robert Jewett (2005). The Troas Project: Investigating Maritime and Land Routes to Clarify the Role of Alexandria Troas in Commerce and Religion. Retrieved 2010-4-15.  Its name was changed by Lysimachus to Alexandria Troas, in memory of Alexander III of Macedon (Pliny merely states that the name changed from Antigonia to Alexandria ). As the chief port of north-west Asia Minor, the place prospered greatly in Roman times, becoming a \"free and autonomous city\" as early as 188 BC,  and the existing remains sufficiently attest its former importance. In its heyday, the city may have had a population of about 100,000.  Strabo mentions that a Roman colony was created at the location in the reign of Augustus, named Colonia Alexandria Augusta Troas (called simply Troas during this period). Augustus, Hadrian and the rich grammarian Herodes Atticus contributed greatly to its embellishment; the aqueduct still preserved is due to the latter. Constantine considered making Troas the capital of the Roman Empire. RomanIn Roman times, it was a significant port for travelling between Anatolia and Europe. Paul of Tarsus sailed for Europe for the first time from Alexandria Troas  and returned there from Europe (it was there that the episode of the raising of Eutychus later occurred ). Ignatius of Antioch also paused at this city before continuing to his martyrdom at Rome.  ByzantineSeveral of its later bishops are known: Marinus in 325; Niconius in 344; Sylvanus at the beginning of the 5th century; Pionius in 451; Leo in 787; Peter, friend of the Patriarch Ignatius, and adversary to Michael, in the ninth century. In the 10th century Troas is given as a suffragan of Cyzicus and distinct from the famous Troy (Heinrich Gelzer, Ungedruckte ... Texte der Notitiae episcopatuum, 552; Georgii Cyprii descriptio orbis romani, 64); it is not known when the city was destroyed and the diocese disappeared. The city remains a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church, Troadensis; the seat is vacant following the resignation of the last bishop in 1971. Troas is also a titular see of the Orthodox Church under the Ecumenical Patriarchate. The most recent hierarch, His Grace Bishop Savas (Zembillas) of Troas,  served 2002-2011. He is now Metropolitan Savas (Zembillas) of Pittsburgh in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America.  OttomanKarasid Turkomans settled in the area of the Troad in the 14th century. Their beylik was conquered by the Ottomans in 1336. The ruins of Alexandria Troas came to be known among the Turks as Eski Stambul, the \"Old City\".  The site\\'s stones were much plundered for building material (for example Mehmed IV took columns to adorn his Yeni Valide Mosque in Istanbul). As of the mid-18th century the site served as \"a lurking place for bandetti\".  ModernBy 1911 the site had been overgrown with vallonea oaks and much plundered, but the circuit of the old walls could still be traced, and in several places they were fairly well preserved. They had a circumference of about ten kilometres, and were fortified with towers at regular intervals. Remains of an ancient bath and gymnasium complex can be found within this area; this building is locally known as Bal Saray (Honey Palace) and was originally endowed by Herodes Atticus in the year 135.  Trajan built an aqueduct which can still be traced. The harbour had two large basins, now almost choked with sand. It is the subject of a recent study by German archaeologists who are digging and surveying at the site. Their excavation has uncovered the remains of a large stadium dating to about 100 BC.

He flourished about 280 BC, in the reign of Ptolemy II Philadelphus.He had an office in the Library of Alexandria, and was commissioned by Ptolemy to make a collection of all the tragedies and satyric dramas that were extant.  He spent some time, together with Antagoras and Aratus, at the court of Antigonus II Gonatas.   Notwithstanding the distinction he enjoyed as a tragic poet, he appears to have had greater merit as a writer of epic poems, elegies, epigrams, and cynaedi.  Among his epic poems, we possess the titles and some fragments of three pieces: the Fisherman,  Kirka or Krika,  which, however, is designated by Athenaeus as doubtful, and Helena,   Of his elegies, some beautiful fragments are still extant.       His Cynaedi, or Ionic poems ( ), are mentioned by Strabo  and Athenaeus.   Some anapaestic verses in praise of Euripides are preserved in Gellius.

An arrangement may include reharmonization, paraphrasing, and/or development of a composition, so that it fully represents the melodic, harmonic, and rhythmic structure\".  Orchestration differs in that it is only adapting music for an orchestra or musical ensemble while arranging \"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings...Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\" (ibid). Classical musicArrangements and transcriptions of classical and serious music go back to the early history of this genre. In particular music written for the piano frequently underwent this treatment.  The suite of ten piano pieces Pictures at an Exhibition by Modest Mussorgsky, has been arranged over twenty times, perhaps the most famous and notable being that of Maurice Ravel.  Due to his lack of expertise in orchestration, the American composer George Gershwin had his Rhapsody in Blue orchestrated and arranged by Ferde Grofé.  Popular musicArrangers in pop music recordings often add parts for orchestral or band instruments involving new material such that the arrangers may reasonably be considered co-composers, although for copyright and royalty purposes usually are not.  Rhythm section parts are usually improvised or otherwise invented by the performers themselves using chord symbols or a lead sheet as a guide.  (Rhythm section instruments usually include guitars, bass guitars, string basses, piano and other keyboard instruments, and drums.)An existing pop song can be re-recorded with a different arrangement to the original. As well as different instruments, the tempo, time signature and key signature may be altered, sometimes drastically so. The end result is a song that retains familiar phrases and lyrics, but offers something new.  This practice was particularly popular in the late 1960s. Well known examples of this include Joe Cocker\\'s version of The Beatles\\' With a Little Help from My Friends, and Ike And Tina Turner\\'s version of Creedence Clearwater Revival\\'s Proud Mary. The American group Vanilla Fudge and British group Yes based their early careers on radical re-arrangements of contemporary hits.  Another and later example would be Bonnie Pointer\\'s disco and Motown-themed versions of \"Heaven Must Have Sent You.\"Some remixes, particularly in dance music, can also be considered re-arrangements in this style. Jonathan Tunick is the most prominent arranger, being one of only twelve people to have won Oscar, Grammy, Emmy, and Tony awards.  Jazz  In jazz an unscored collaborative arrangement is called a \"head arrangement\" (Randel 2002, p.\\xa0294; it is in the head of the musician(s)). Big bands such as those of Duke Ellington (at the very beginning of his career), Bennie Moten, and Count Basie performed head arrangements (ibid).Arrangements for small jazz combos are usually informal, minimal, and uncredited. This was particularly so for combos in the bebop era. In general, the larger the ensemble, the greater the need for a formal arrangement, although the early Count Basie big band was famous for its head arrangements, so called because they were worked out by the players themselves, memorized immediately and never written down. Most arrangements for large ensembles, big bands, in the swing era, were written down, however, and credited to a specific arranger, as were later arrangements for the Count Basie big band by Sammy Nestico and Neal Hefti. Don Redman made significant innovations in the pattern of arrangement in Fletcher Henderson\\'s orchestra in the 1920s. He introduced the pattern of arranging melodies in the body of arrangements and arranging section performances of the big band. Benny Carter became Fletcher\\'s main arranger in the early 30\\'s, moving on become as famous for his arranging expertise as his musicianship. Billy Strayhorn was an arranger of great renown in the Duke Ellington orchestra beginning in 1938.Jelly Roll Morton is considered the earliest jazz arranger, writing down the parts when he was touring about 1912-1915 so that pick-up bands could play his compositions. Big band arrangements are informally called charts. In the swing era they were usually either arrangements of popular songs or they were entirely new compositions. Duke Ellington\\'s and Billy Strayhorn\\'s arrangements for the Duke Ellington big band were usually new compositions, and some of Eddie Sauter\\'s arrangements for the Benny Goodman band and Artie Shaw\\'s arrangements for his own band were new compositions as well. It became more common to arrange sketchy jazz combo compositions for big band after the bop era. After 1950, the big bands declined in number. However, several bands continued and arrangers provided renowned arrangements. Gil Evans wrote a number of large-ensemble arrangements in the late fifties and early sixties intended for recording sessions only.  Other arrangers of note include Vic Schoen, Pete Rugolo, Oliver Nelson, Johnny Richards, Billy May, Thad Jones, Maria Schneider, Bob Brookmeyer, Steve Sample, Sr, Lou Marini, Nelson Riddle, Ralph Burns, Billy Byers, Gordon Jenkins, Ray Conniff, Henry Mancini, and Ray Reach.In the 21st century, the Big Band arrangement has made a modest comeback. Gordon Goodwin, Roy Hargrove, and Christian McBride have all rolled out New Big Bands with both original compositions and new arrangements of standard tunes.   Arranging for instrumental groups StringsThe string section is a body of instruments composed of various stringed instruments. By the 19th century orchestral music in Europe had standardized the string section into the following homogeneous instrumental groups: first violins, second violins, violas, cellos, and double basses. The string section in a multi-sectioned orchestra is referred sometimes to as the “string choir.”  The harp is also a stringed instrument, but is not a member of or homogenous with the violin family and is not considered part of the string choir. Samuel Adler classifies the harp as a plucked string instrument in the same category as the guitar (acoustic or electric), mandolin, banjo, or zither.   Like the harp these instruments do not belong to the violin family and are not homogenous with the string choir. In modern arranging these instruments are considered part of the rhythm section. The electric string bass and upright string bass—depending on the circumstance—can be treated by the arranger as either string section or rhythm section instruments.  A group of instruments in which each member plays a unique part—rather than playing in unison with other like instruments—is referred to as a chamber ensemble.   A chamber ensemble made up entirely of strings of the violin family is referred to by its size. A string trio consists of three players, a string quartet four, a string quintet five, and so on. In most circumstances the string section is treated by the arranger as one homogenous unit and its members are required to play preconceived material rather than improvise.A string section can be utilized on its own (this is referred to as a string orchestra)   or in conjunction with any of the other instrumental sections. More than one string orchestra can be utilized.A standard string section (vln., vln 2., vla., vcl, cb.) with each section playing unison allows the arranger to create a five-part texture. Often an arranger will divide each violin section in half or thirds to achieve a denser texture. It is possible to carry this division to its logical extreme in which each member of the string section plays his or her own unique part. Size of the string sectionArtistic, budgetary and logistical concerns will determine the size and instrumentation of a string section. Due to the large percussion section utilized in the Broadway musical West Side Story, composer Leonard Bernstein chose to utilize a string section without violas.  George Martin, producer and arranger for The Beatles, warns arrangers about the intonation issues when only two like instruments play in unison. \"After a string quartet,\" Martin explains, \"I do not think there is a satisfactory sound for strings until one has at least three players on each line...as a rule two stringed instruments together create a slight \"beat\" which does not give a smooth sound.\"  While any combination and number of string instruments is possible in a section, a traditional string section sound is achieved with a violin-heavy balance of instruments.

It is in adapted ottava rima and is full of elaborate use of literary devices, particularly alliteration. The theme, which purports to be autobiographical, is that of rejected love. The (male) speaker deplores the ruin of his life, and in tones at times reminiscent of Hamlet, craves oblivion, for which the sea serves as a constant metaphor.The Triumph of Time is also the US title of James Blish's novel A Clash of Cymbals. External links  Complete text of the poem Victorian Web article on the poem\",1943: 'Australian Democrats         The Australian Democrats is an Australian political party espousing a socially liberal ideology. It was formed in 1977, by a merger of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement, after having secured former Liberal minister Don Chipp as a high-profile leader.  The party\\'s 30-year representation in the Parliament of Australia ended on 30 June 2008, after the loss of its four remaining Senate seats; two of the senators had retired from politics and the other two were defeated at the 2007 election, in which the party polled only 1.29% of the national Senate vote.   The party is based on the principles of honesty, tolerance, compassion and direct democracy through postal ballots of all members, so that \"there should be no hierarchical structure ... by which a carefully engineered elite could make decisions for the members.\" Chipp D and Larkin J The Third Man Rigby, Melbourne (1978) ISBN 0-7270-0827-7   From the outset, members\\' participation was fiercely protected in national and divisional constitutions prescribing internal elections, regular meeting protocols, annual conferences—and monthly journals for open discussion and balloting. Dispute resolution procedures were established, with final recourse to a party ombudsman and membership ballot.Policies determined by the unique participatory method promoted environmental awareness and sustainability, opposition to the primacy of economic rationalism (Australian neoliberalism), preventative approaches to human health and welfare, animal rights, rejection of nuclear technology and weapons.The Australian Democrats were the first representatives of green politics at the federal level in Australia. They played a key role in the cause célèbre of the Franklin River Dam.The party\\'s centrist role makes it subject to criticism from both the right and left of the political spectrum. In particular, Chipp\\'s former conservative affiliation was frequently recalled by opponents on the left. Such as the then Socialist Workers\\' Party and early green-left parties such as the United Tasmania Group.  This problem was to torment later leaders and strategists who, by 1991, were proclaiming \"the electoral objective\" as a higher priority than the rigorous participatory democracy espoused by the party\\'s founders. The first substantive reason given by rebellious senators for deposing leader Janet Powell in 1991 was her alleged failure to develop a media profile which would attract more electoral support. The first conclusive constitutional abandonment of founding principles was probably the July 1993, decision of the party\\'s national executive to terminate monthly publication of the members\\' National Journal and to replace it with less frequent publication of glossy promotional material. Over three decades, the Australian Democrats achieved representation in the legislatures of the ACT, South Australia, New South Wales, Western Australia and Tasmania as well as Senate seats in all six states. However, at the 2004 and 2007 elections, all seven of its Senate seats were lost.  History 1977–79 On the evening of 29 April 1977, Don Chipp addressed an overflowing Perth Town Hall meeting which unanimously passed a resolution to form a Centre-Line Party, which Chipp was invited to lead  —but he firmly declined to reverse his avowed decision to quit politics, having resigned from the Liberal Party and been offered a lucrative position as a radio public affairs commentator. The Centre-Line Party was the provisional title of the Australian Democrats party.    The occasion was a meeting at the Perth Town Hall to which Don Chipp had been invited in the hope that he would accept the position of leader of the new party, which would be an amalgamation of the Australia Party and the New Liberal Movement. On that occasion, Chipp declined to commit himself but did so at a corresponding public meeting in Melbourne on 9 May 1977. Chipp received a standing ovation from over 3,000 people, including former Prime Minister John Gorton, and decided to commit himself to leading the new party which was already being constructed by a national steering committee.   The new party was eventually renamed the Australian Democrats by a ballot of its membership. \"Fifty-six suggestions produced by members were listed on the ballot paper, including Uniting Australia Party, Australian Centre Line Party, Dinkum Democrats, Practical Idealists of Australia and People for Sanity Party!! After the ballot, the suggestion of the Steering Committee, \\'Australian Democrats\\', was overwhelmingly accepted.\"   The name \"Australian Democrats\" was already in informal currency before this decision. The first Australian Democrats (AD) federal parliamentarian was Senator Janine Haines who filled Steele Hall\\'s casual Senate vacancy for South Australia in 1977. Surprisingly, she was not a candidate when the party contested the 1977 federal elections after Don Chipp had agreed to be leader and figurehead. Members and candidates were not lacking in electoral experience, since the Australia Party had been contesting all federal elections since 1969 and the Liberal Movement, in 1974 and 1975. The party\\'s broad aim was to achieve a balance of power in one or more parliaments and to exercise it responsibly in line with policies determined by membership.The grassroot support attracted by Chipp\\'s leadership was measurable at the party\\'s first electoral test at the 1977 federal election on 10 December, when 9.38 per cent of the total Lower House vote was polled and 11.13 per cent of the Senate vote. At that time, with five Senate seats being contested in each state, the required quota was a daunting 16.66 per cent. However, the first 6-year-term seats were won by Don Chipp (Vic) and Colin Mason (NSW). 1980–82At a Melbourne media conference in 1980, Chipp described his party\\'s aim as to \"keep the bastards honest\"—the \"bastards\" being the major parties and/or politicians in general. This became a long-lived slogan for the Democrats.The Australian Democrats\\' first national conference, on 16–17 February 1980, was opened by the distinguished nuclear physicist and former governor of South Australia, Sir Mark Oliphant, who said:  I was privileged to be in the chair at the public meeting in Melbourne when [Don Chipp] announced formation of a new party, dedicated to preserve what freedoms we still retain, and to increase them. A party in which dictatorship from the top was replaced by consensus. A party not ordered about by big business and the rich, or by union bosses. A party where a man could retain freedom of conscience and not thereby be faced with expulsion. A party to which the intelligent individual could belong without having to subscribe to a dogmatic creed. In other words, a democratic party.    At the October 1980 election, the Democrats polled 9.25 per cent of the Senate vote, electing Janine Haines (SA) and two new senators Michael Macklin (Qld) and John Siddons (Vic), bringing the party\\'s strength to five Senate seats from 1 July 1981 .A South Australian by-election in the state seat of Mitcham (now Waite) in 1982 saw Heather Southcott retain the seat for the Democrats from Robin Millhouse since 1955 (Democrat since 1977), however it was lost later that year at the 1982 state election. Mitcham was the only single-member lower house seat anywhere in Australia to be won by the Democrats. 1987–90 It had been expected that the Democrats would find it difficult to win seats at the next Senate election due in 1987. However, their task was assisted by the calling of a double dissolution election by Prime Minister, Bob Hawke. This reduced the quota necessary to win a seat to 7.7%. In NSW (Paul McLean), Victoria (Janet Powell) and South Australia (Janine Haines), 6 year terms were won. In South Australia, a second senator (John Coulter) was elected to 3 year term, and short terms were also won Michael Macklin in Queensland and Jean Jenkins in Western Australia. 1990–91  See \\'Give a Damn: Vote Democrat 1\\' campaign commercial 1990 saw the voluntary departure from the Senate of Janine Haines (a step with which not all Democrats agreed) and the narrow failure of her strategic goal of winning the House of Representatives seat known as the Division of Kingston.Her casual vacancy was filled by Meg Lees several months before the arrival of Cheryl Kernot, elected to replace the retiring deputy leader Michael Macklin. The ambitious Kernot immediately contested the Senate leadership. Being unemployed at the time, she requested and obtained party funds to pay for her travel to address members in all seven divisions.  In the event, Victorian Janet Powell was elected as leader and John Coulter was chosen as deputy leader.Despite the loss of Haines and the WA Senate seat (through an inconsistent national preference agreement with the ALP), the 1990 federal election heralded something of a rebirth for the party, with a dramatic rise in primary vote. This was at the same time as an economic recession was building, and events such as the Gulf War in Kuwait were beginning to shepherd issues of globalisation and transnational trade on to national government agendas. Election Results Senate – National  1977: 11.1% 1980:  9.3% 1983:  9.6% 1984:  7.6% 1987:  8.5% 1990: 12.6% 1993:  5.3% 1996: 10.8% 1998:  8.4% 2001:  7.3% 2004:  2.1% 2007:  1.3% 2010:  0.6%   Virtually alone on the Australian political landscape, Janet Powell consistently attacked both the government and opposition which had closed ranks in support of the Gulf War. Whereas the House of Representatives was thus able to avoid any debate about the war and Australia\\'s participation, The sole independent member in the House, Ted Mack, was unable to launch his critical motion for lack of a seconder.   the Democrats took full advantage of the opportunity to move for a debate in the Senate. Possibly because of the party\\'s opposition to the Gulf War, there was mass-media antipathy and negative publicity which some construed as poor media performance by Janet Powell, the party\\'s standing having stalled at about 10%. Before 12 months of her leadership had passed, the South Australian and Queensland divisions were circulating the party\\'s first-ever petition to criticise and oust the parliamentary leader. The explicit grounds related to Powell\\'s alleged responsibility for poor AD ratings in Gallup and other media surveys of potential voting support. When this charge was deemed insufficient, interested party officers and senators reinforced it with negative media \\'leaks\\' concerning her openly established relationship with Sid Spindler and exposure of administrative failings resulting in excessive overtime to a staff member. With National Executive blessing, the party room pre-empted the ballot by replacing the leader with deputy John Coulter. In the process, severe internal divisions were generated. One major collateral casualty was the party whip Paul McLean who resigned and quit the Senate in disgust at what he perceived as in-fighting between close friends. The casual NSW vacancy created by his resignation was filled by Karin Sowada. Powell duly left the party, along with many leading figures of the Victorian branch of the party, and unsuccessfully stood as an Independent candidate when her term expired. In later years, she campaigned for the Australian Greens. PolicyThe party\\'s original support base consisted of voters alienated by perceived unproductive adversarial conflict between the two mainstream parties and an emerging new constituency of people with a desire to participate more effectively in government and to promote concerns for environmental protection and social justice. The party aimed to combine liberal social policies with centrist, particularly neo-Keynesian economics and a progressive environmental platform.The original agenda included interventionist economic policies, commitment to environmental causes, support for   with Australia\\'s indigenous population through such mechanisms as formal treaties, pacifist approaches to international relations, open government, constitutional reform, progressive approaches to social issues such as sexuality and drugs, and strong support for human rights and civil liberties. Its membership largely comprised tertiary-educated and middle-class constituents. The party also appealed to voters opposed to untrammelled government power and wishing to have alternative views aired in parliaments and media.The party has a platform of participatory democracy, with policies supporting proportional representation and citizen-initiated referenda. Many important internal issues (such as electoral preselection and leadership) are decided by direct postal ballot of the membership. Although policies are theoretically set in a similar fashion, Australian Democrats parliamentarians generally had extensive freedom in interpreting them.However, by 1980, the Australian Democrats had employed the postal-ballot method at both national at state levels to develop an extensive body of written policy covering not only the political agendas of the day but also innovative and far-sighted policies for environmental and economic sustainability, water and energy conservation, e.g., through development of alternative energy sources, expanded public transport, etc. To the community\\'s growing concerns about human rights, the Australian Democrats added finely detailed policies on animal welfare and species preservation. The material is available in election manifestos and copies of the party\\'s journals, obtainable in major public libraries.In 2009, as part of the Rebuild process, the party announced a comprehensive review of all policies.  Electoral fortunes  The Australian Democrats\\' electoral fortunes have fluctuated throughout their history.During the Hawke and Keating Labor Governments (1983–96), the Australian Democrats held a theoretical balance of power in the Senate: the numbers were such that they could team with Labor to pass legislation, or team with the Coalition to block legislation on occasions when the Coalition decided to oppose a government bill.Their power was weakened in 1996 after the Howard Government was elected, and a Labor senator, Mal Colston, resigned from the Labor party. This meant that the Australian Democrats now shared the parliamentary balance of power with two Independent senators. As a result, the Coalition government could often bypass the Australian Democrats, and pass legislation by negotiating with Colston and Brian Harradine. Following the 1998 election the Australian Democrats again held the balance of power, until the Coalition gained a Senate majority at the 2004 election.The Hawke and Keating governments pursued economic policies that drew on economic rationalist and neo-liberal thought, and the Australian Democrats positioned themselves to the left of the ALP government, and thus at the left end of mainstream Australian politics. Their appeal (and focus on issues beyond the usual \"economic\" ones that monopolised major party attention) was always greatest amongst tertiary-educated voters. However, the party\\'s progressive politics also remained attractive to a sizeable section of mainly middle class (\"wet\") Liberal supporters – often female, and often disparagingly described on the right of the Liberal Party as \"Soccer Mums\"  or \"Doctor\\'s Wives\" – who were turned off by the Liberal party\\'s social conservatism and \"Reagonomic/Thatcherite\" economic policies. Many Liberals saw their support of the Australian Democrats in the Senate as having \"an each way bet\", ameliorating the effect of their support for the Liberals in the House of Representatives – an attitude positively fostered, not unsurprisingly, by Democrat politicians and campaigners.Cheryl Kernot became leader in 1993. She had strong media appeal, which increased media and public awareness of herself and the party. She was known to have interests in industrial relations and was able to cultivate solid relationships with Labor government frontbenchers, which also added to her credibility in the press gallery.Lack of clear direction other than, possibly, senators\\' common ambition to play a more productive role in government manifested itself in tensions over Cheryl Kernot\\'s policy on industrial relations (see the Workplace Relations Act 1996). Under Kernot, after negotiations and some compromises from the government, the Australian Democrats voted for the Howard Government\\'s right-leaning industrial relations legislation which decreased union power and allowed a larger role for individual employer-employee contracts. Kernot, however, remained broadly opposed to the Liberal government. This, together with her personal ambition for a role and contribution to strategy in government,  led her to defect to the ALP in 1997. Her replacement as leader was by long-serving deputy, Meg Lees. Under Lees\\' leadership, in the 1998 federal election, the Democrats\\' candidate John Schumann came within 2 per cent of taking Liberal Foreign Minister Alexander Downer\\'s seat of Mayo in the Adelaide Hills under Australia\\'s preferential voting system.  The party\\'s Senate representation increased to nine Senators.Internal conflict and leadership tensions from 2000 to 2002, blamed on the party\\'s support for the Government\\'s Goods and Services Tax (GST), was damaging to the Democrats.Opposed by the Labor Party, the Australian Greens and independent Senator Brian Harradine, the GST required Democrat support to pass. In an election fought on tax, the Democrats publicly stated that they liked neither the Liberal (GST) tax package or the Labor package, but pledged to work with whichever party was elected to make their tax package better. They campaigned with the slogan \"No GST on food\".  In 1999, after negotiations with Prime Minister Howard, Meg Lees, Andrew Murray and the party room Senators agreed to support the A New Tax System (ANTS) legislation  with exemptions from GST for most food and some medicines, as well as many environmental and social concessions.   Five Australian Democrats senators voted in favour.  However, two dissident senators on the party\\'s left Natasha Stott Despoja and Andrew Bartlett voted against the GST.   In 2001, a leadership spill saw Meg Lees replaced as leader  by Natasha Stott Despoja after a very public and bitter leadership battle.  Despite criticism of Stott Despoja\\'s youth and lack of experience, the 2001 election saw the Democrats receive similar media coverage to the previous election.  Despite the internal divisions, the Australian Democrats\\' election result in 2001 was quite good. However, it was not enough to prevent the loss of Vicki Bourne\\'s Senate seat in NSW.Resulting tensions between Stott Despoja and Lees led to Meg Lees leaving the party in 2002, becoming an independent and forming the Australian Progressive Alliance.  Stott Despoja stood down from the leadership following a loss of confidence by her party room colleagues.  It led to a protracted leadership battle in 2002, which eventually led to the election of Senator Andrew Bartlett as leader.On 6 December 2003, Andrew Bartlett stepped aside temporarily as leader of the party, after an incident in which he assaulted Liberal Senator Jeannie Ferris on the floor of Parliament while intoxicated.  The party issued a statement stating that Deputy Leader Lyn Allison would serve as the Acting Leader of the party. Bartlett apologised to the Democrats, Jeannie Ferris and the Australian public for his behaviour and assured all concerned that it would never happen again. On 29 January 2004, after seeking medical treatment, Bartlett returned to the Australian Democrats leadership, vowing to abstain from alcohol. 2004  Support for the Australian Democrats fell significantly at the 2004 federal election in which they achieved only 2.4 per cent of the national vote. Nowhere was this more noticeable than in their key support base of suburban Adelaide in South Australia, where they received between 7 and 31 per cent of the Lower House vote in 2001, and between 1 and 4 per cent in 2004. Three incumbent senators were defeated—Aden Ridgeway (NSW), Brian Greig (WA) and John Cherry (Qld). Following the loss, the customary post-election leadership ballot installed Lyn Allison as leader and Andrew Bartlett as her deputy.From 1 July 2005 the Australian Democrats lost official parliamentary party status, being represented by only four senators while the governing Liberal-National Coalition gained a majority and potential control of the Senate—the first time this advantage had been enjoyed by any government since 1980. 2006On 5 January 2006, the ABC reported that the Tasmanian Electoral Commission had de-registered that division of the party for failing to provide a list containing the required number of members to be registered for Tasmanian state and local elections. On 18 March 2006, at the 2006 South Australian state election, the Australian Democrats were reduced to 1.7 per cent of the Legislative Council (upper house) vote. Their sole councillor up for re-election, Kate Reynolds, was defeated.After the election, South Australian senator Natasha Stott Despoja denied rumours that she was considering quitting the party. In early July, Richard Pascoe, national and South Australian party president, resigned, citing slumping opinion polls and the poor result in the 2006 South Australian election as well as South Australian parliamentary leader Sandra Kanck\\'s comments regarding the drug MDMA which he saw as damaging to the party.   On 5 July 2006, Australian Democrats senator for Western Australia Andrew Murray announced his intention not to contest the 2007 federal election, citing frustration arising from the Howard Government\\'s control of both houses and his unwillingness to serve another six-year term.  His term ended on 30 June 2008.On 28 August 2006, the founder of the Australian Democrats, Don Chipp, died. Former prime minister Bob Hawke said: \"... there is a coincidental timing almost between the passing of Don Chipp and what I think is the death throes of the Democrats.  \"On 22 October 2006, Australian Democrats Senator Natasha Stott Despoja announced her intention not to seek re-election at the 2007 federal election due to health concerns.  Her term ended on 30 June 2008.In November 2006, the Australian Democrats fared very poorly in the Victorian state election, receiving a Legislative Council vote tally of only 0.83%,  less than half of the party\\'s result in 2002 (1.79 per cent).  2007In the New South Wales state election of March 2007, the Australian Democrats lost their last remaining NSW Upper House representative, Arthur Chesterfield-Evans. The party fared poorly, gaining only 1.8 per cent of the Legislative Council vote. A higher vote was achieved in some of the Legislative Assembly seats selectively contested as compared to 2003. However, the statewide vote share fell because the party was unable to field as many candidates as in 2003.In the Victorian state by-election in Albert Park District  the Australian Democrats stood candidate Paul Kavanagh, who polled a respectable 5.75 per cent of the primary vote, despite a large number of candidates, and all media attention focusing on the battle between Labor and Greens candidates.On 13 September 2007, the ACT Democrats (Australian Capital Territory Division of the party) was deregistered  by the ACT Electoral Commissioner, being unable to demonstrate a minimum membership of 100 electors.The Democrats had no success at the 2007 federal election. Two incumbent senators, Lyn Allison (Victoria) and Andrew Bartlett (Queensland), were defeated, their seats both reverting to major parties. Their two remaining colleagues, Andrew Murray (WA) and Natasha Stott Despoja (SA), did not run for new terms. All four senators\\' terms expired on 30 June 2008—leaving the Australian Democrats with no federal representation for the first time since its founding in 1977. An ABC report noted that \"on the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) website the party is now referred to just as \\'other\\'\".  2008The party achieved only 1.24% of the vote at the federal 2008 Mayo by-election in South Australia. At the Australian Capital Territory general election, 2008, the party\\'s ungrouped candidates  obtained 0.3% of the vote for Ginninderra  (Darren Churchill) and 0.2% in Molonglo  (Greg Tannahill). 2009In January 2009, South Australian MLC, Sandra Kanck retired after 15 years in Parliament. She was replaced by her media adviser, David Winderlich.  In July 2009, David Winderlich, announced he would leave the party and sit as an independent unless the South Australian Democrats could recruit 1,000 new members by November 2009.  When this clearly could not eventuate, he resigned from the party on 7 October 2009, continued to sit as an independent  and was defeated at the 2010 election, in which the Democrats polled less than one percent of the Upper House vote in their registered home state. During the year, the party attempted to reconstruct by reducing membership fees.  In December, former staffer David Collyer contested the federal 2009 Higgins by-election and received 2.3 percent of the vote,  a tally which was exceeded by those of the Greens (32.4%), the DLP (3.85%) and the newly founded Sex Party (3.21%). 2010The South Australian Democrats contested the state election on 20 March 2010. The lead Legislative Council candidate was animal rights activist and former independent, Jeanie Walker  with supporting candidates Tom Salerno and Sandra Kanck  They attracted 0.9% of the total primary vote.  However, on preferences, Jeanie Walker survived until the 35th round of counting, losing to micro-party Dignity for Disability\\'s Kelly Vincent who was elected in the 43rd round.  Eight House of Assembly seats were also contested, averaging 2.24 per cent of the vote in those seats.At the 2010 federal election, Democrat candidates again failed to secure a Senate seat. They polled very poorly, achieving only 0.63% of the national vote,  their best divisional result being 1.77%  in the ACT. 2012In March 2012, the Australian Electoral Commission queried a Democrats submission of 550 names of purported members and proposed deregistering the party for having fewer than 500 members, the threshold needed for registration.  The party survived this inquiry, the Commission finding that the party had a sufficient membership number to continue registration. The party executive has committed to contesting the next Australian federal election.  The Northern Territory was accorded a formal status as part of the division of Western Australia. In July 2012, former WA senator Brian Greig was elected national president \"to resurrect the Australian Democrats as they attempt to take advantage of present political unrest\".  Trenwith, Courtney Democrats\\' comeback inspired by \\'inflexible\\' Greens Sydney Morning Herald, 21 July 2012  However, he left the position two months later, and the party\\'s national secretary reported \"severe friction\" within the party. The Democrats won 10.8 percent of the vote at the 2012 Heffron state by-election coming third of four candidates in the absence of a Liberal Party candidate. On the 11th of December 2012 the National Executive expelled former South Australian MLC, Sandra Kanck, following continued dissatisfaction with Ms Kanck’s attempts to close and/or merge the Australian Democrats with various population abatement groups that Ms Kanck heads or is affiliated with.   SupportSupport for the Democrats historically tended to fluctuate between about 5 and 10 per cent of the population and was geographically concentrated around the wealthy dense CBD and inner-suburban neighbourhoods of the capital cities (especially Adelaide). Therefore, they never managed to win a House of Representatives seat. During the 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s they typically held one or two Senate seats in each state, as well as having some representatives in state parliaments.  Following the internal conflict over GST (1998–2001) and resultant leadership changes, a dramatic decline occurred in the Democrats\\' membership and voting support in all states. Simultaneously, an increase was recorded in support for the Australian Greens who, by 2004, were supplanting the Democrats as a substantial third party. The trend was noted that year by political scientists Dean Jaensch et al.  Elsewhere, Jaensch later suggested it was possible the Democrats could make a political comeback in the federal arena. Following Tony Abbott\\'s displacement of Malcolm Turnbull as federal leader of the Liberal Party in 2009, the Democrats sought to attract the support of \"those Liberals who no longer feel they can support their party\".  Federal parliamentary leadersOf the party\\'s nine elected federal parliamentary leaders, six were women. Aboriginal senator Aden Ridgeway was deputy leader under Natasha Stott Despoja.

He is known as the father of modern taxonomy, and is also considered one of the fathers of modern ecology. Many of his writings were in Latin, and his name is rendered in Latin as   (after 1761 Carolus a Linné).Linnaeus was born in the countryside of Småland, in southern Sweden. Linnaeus received most of his higher education at Uppsala University, and began giving lectures in botany there in 1730. He lived abroad between 1735 and 1738, where he studied and also published a first edition of his   in the Netherlands. He then returned to Sweden, where he became professor of botany at Uppsala. In the 1740s, he was sent on several journeys through Sweden to find and classify plants and animals. In the 1750s and 60s, he continued to collect and classify animals, plants, and minerals, and published several volumes. At the time of his death, he was one of the most acclaimed scientists in Europe.The Swiss philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau sent him the message: \"Tell him I know no greater man on earth.\"    The German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe wrote: \"With the exception of Shakespeare and Spinoza, I know no one among the no longer living who has influenced me more strongly.\"  Swedish author August Strindberg wrote: \"Linnaeus was in reality a poet who happened to become a naturalist\".    Among other compliments, Linnaeus has been called   (Prince of Botanists), \"The Pliny of the North,\" and \"The Second Adam\". Broberg (2006), p. 7. In botany, the author abbreviation used to indicate Linnaeus as the authority for species\\' names is L.  In 1959, Carl Linnaeus was designated as the lectotype for Homo sapiens,  which means that following the nomenclatural rules, Homo sapiens was validly defined as the animal species to which Linnaeus belonged. Biography Early life ChildhoodCarl Linnaeus was born in the village of Råshult in Småland, Sweden on 23 May 1707. He was the first child of Nils Ingemarsson Linnaeus and Christina Brodersonia. His father was the first in his ancestry to adopt a permanent surname. Before that, ancestors had used the patronymic naming system of Scandinavian countries: his father was named Ingemarsson after his father Ingemar Bengtsson. When Nils was admitted to the University of Lund, he had to take on a family name. He adopted the Latinate name Linnæus after a giant linden tree (or lime tree),   in Swedish, that grew on the family homestead. Blunt (2004), p. 12.  This name was spelled with the æ ligature. When Carl was born, he was named Carl Linnæus, with his father\\'s family name. The son also always spelled it with the æ ligature, both in handwritten documents and in publications. Blunt (2004), p. 13.  Carl\\'s patronymic would have been Nilsson, as in Carl Nilsson Linnæus.One of a long line of peasants and priests, Nils was an amateur botanist, a Lutheran minister, and the curate of the small village of Stenbrohult in Småland. Christina was the daughter of the rector of Stenbrohult, Samuel Brodersonius. She subsequently gave birth to three daughters and another son, Samuel (who would eventually succeed their father as rector of Stenbrohult and write a manual on beekeeping).  Stöver (1974), p. 8.  Broberg (2006), p. 10.  A year after Linnaeus\\' birth, his grandfather Samuel Brodersonius died, and his father Nils became the rector of Stenbrohult. The family moved into the rectory from the curate\\'s house.  Quammen (2007), p. 1. Even in his early years, Linnaeus seemed to have a liking for plants, flowers in particular. Whenever he was upset, he was given a flower, which immediately calmed him. Nils spent much time in his garden and often showed flowers to Linnaeus and told him their names. Soon Linnaeus was given his own patch of earth where he could grow plants. Blunt (2004), p. 15.  Early educationLinnaeus\\' father began teaching him Latin, religion, and geography at an early age; one account says that due to family use of Latin for conversation, the boy learned Latin before he learned Swedish. When Linnaeus was seven, Nils decided to hire a tutor for him. The parents picked Johan Telander, a son of a local yeoman. Linnaeus did not like him, writing in his autobiography that Telander \"was better calculated to extinguish a child\\'s talents than develop them.\" Blunt (2004), pp. 15–16.  Two years after his tutoring had begun, he was sent to the Lower Grammar School at Växjö in 1717. Stöver (1974), p. 5.  Linnaeus rarely studied, often going to the countryside to look for plants. He reached the last year of the Lower School when he was fifteen, which was taught by the headmaster, Daniel Lannerus, who was interested in botany. Lannerus noticed Linnaeus\\' interest in botany and gave him the run of his garden. He also introduced him to Johan Rothman, the state doctor of Småland and a teacher at Växjö Gymnasium. Also a botanist, Rothman broadened Linnaeus\\' interest in botany and helped him develop an interest in medicine. Blunt (2004), p. 16.  Stöver (1974), pp. 5–6.  At the age of 17, Linnaeus had become well acquainted with the existing botanical litterature. He remarks in his journal ”read day and night, knowing like the back of my hand, Arvidh Månsson´s Rydaholm Book of Herbs, Tillandz´s Flora Åboensis, Palmberg´s Serta Florea Suecana,  Bromelii Chloros Gothica and Rudbeckii Hortus Upsaliensis..”   Linnaeus entered the Växjö Gymnasium in 1724, where he studied mainly Greek, Hebrew, theology and mathematics, a curriculum designed for boys preparing for the priesthood. Stöver (1974), p. 6.  Blunt (2004), pp. 16–17.  In the last year at the gymnasium, Linnaeus\\' father visited to ask the professors how his son\\'s studies were progressing; to his dismay, most said that the boy would never become a scholar. Rothman believed otherwise, suggesting Linnaeus could have a future in medicine. The doctor offered to have Linnaeus live with his family in Växjö and to teach him physiology and botany. Nils accepted this offer. Blunt (2004), pp. 17–18.  Stöver (1974), pp. 8–11.  University LundRothman showed Linnaeus that botany was a serious subject. He taught Linnaeus to classify plants according to Tournefort\\'s system. Linnaeus was also taught about the sexual reproduction of plants, according to Sébastien Vaillant.  In 1727, Linnaeus, age 21, enrolled in Lund University in Skåne. Blunt (2004), p. 18.  Stöver (1974), p. 13.  He was registered as  , the Latin form of his full name, which he also used later for his Latin publications. Professor Kilian Stobæus, natutral scientist, physician and historian, offered Linnaeus tutoring and lodging, as well as the use of his library, which included many books about botany. He also gave the student free admission to his lectures. Blunt (2004), pp. 21–22.  Stöver (1974), p. 15.  In his spare time, Linnaeus explored the flora of Skåne, together with students sharing the same interests. Stöver (1974), pp. 14–15.  Uppsala In August 1728, Linnaeus decided to attend Uppsala University on the advice of Rothman, who believed it would be a better choice if Linnaeus wanted to study both medicine and botany. Rothman based this recommendation on the two professors who taught at the medical faculty at Uppsala: Olof Rudbeck the Younger and Lars Roberg. Although Rudbeck and Roberg had undoubtedly been good professors, by then they were older and not so interested in teaching. Rudbeck no longer gave public lectures, and had others stand in for him. The botany, zoology, pharmacology and anatomy lectures were not in their best state. Blunt (2004), pp. 23–25.  In Uppsala, Linnaeus met a new benefactor, Olof Celsius, who was a professor of theology and an amateur botanist. Blunt (2004), pp. 31–32.  He received Linnaeus into his home and allowed him use of his library, which was one of the richest botanical libraries in Sweden. Stöver (1974), pp. 19–20. In 1729, Linnaeus wrote a thesis,   on plant sexual reproduction. This attracted the attention of Rudbeck; in May 1730, he selected Linnaeus to give lectures at the University although the young man was only a second-year student. His lectures were popular, and Linnaeus often addressed an audience of 300 people. Blunt (2004), pp. 32–34.  In June, Linnaeus moved from Celsius\\' house to Rudbeck\\'s to become the tutor of the three youngest of his 24 children. His friendship with Celsius did not wane and they continued their botanical expeditions. Blunt (2004), p. 34–37.  Over that winter, Linnaeus began to doubt Tournefort\\'s system of classification and decided to create one of his own. His plan was to divide the plants by the number of stamens and pistils. He began writing several books, which would later result in, for example,   and  . He also produced a book on the plants grown in the Uppsala Botanical Garden,  . Blunt (2001), pp. 36–37. Rudbeck\\'s former assistant, Nils Rosén, returned to the University in March 1731 with a degree in medicine. Rosén started giving anatomy lectures and tried to take over Linnaeus\\' botany lectures, but Rudbeck prevented that. Until December, Rosén gave Linnaeus private tutoring in medicine. In December, Linnaeus had a \"disagreement\" with Rudbeck\\'s wife and had to move out of his mentor\\'s house; his relationship with Rudbeck did not appear to suffer. That Christmas, Linnaeus returned home to Stenbrohult to visit his parents for the first time in about three years. His mother had disapproved of his failing to become a priest, but she was pleased to learn he was teaching at the University.  Anderson (1997), p. 40.  Expedition to Lapland  During a visit with his parents, Linnaeus told them about his plan to travel to Lapland; Rudbeck had made the journey in 1695, but the detailed results of his exploration were lost in a fire seven years afterwards. Linnaeus\\' hope was to find new plants, animals and possibly valuable minerals. He was also curious about the customs of the native Sami people, reindeer-herding nomads who wandered Scandinavia\\'s vast tundras. In April 1732, Linnaeus was awarded a grant from the Royal Society of Sciences in Uppsala for his journey. Anderson (1997), pp. 42–43.  Blunt (2001), p. 38. Linnaeus began his expedition from Uppsala in May; he travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. Blunt (2001), pp. 42–43.  He sometimes dismounted on the way to examine a flower or rock Anderson (1997), pp. 43–44.  and was particularly interested in mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common animal in Lapland. Anderson (1997), p. 46. Linnaeus travelled clockwise around the coast of the Gulf of Bothnia, making major inland incursions from Umeå, Luleå and Tornio. He returned from his six-month long, over   expedition in October, having gathered and observed many plants, birds and rocks. Blunt (2001), pp. 63–65.  Blunt (2004), pp. 39–42.  Broberg (2006), p. 29.  Although Lapland was a region with limited biodiversity, Linnaeus described about 100 previously unidentified plants. These became the basis of his book  . Quammen (2007), p. 2.  Stöver (1974), pp. 38–39. In   Linnaeus\\' ideas about nomenclature and classification were first used in a practical way, making this the first proto-modern Flora.  The account covered 534 species, used the Linnaean classification system and included, for the described species, geographical distribution and taxonomic notes. It was Augustin Pyramus de Candolle who attributed Linnaeus with   as the first example in the botanical genre of Flora writing. Botanical historian E. L. Greene described   as \"the most classic and delightful\" of Linnaeus\\'s works. Frodin (2001), p. 27. It was also during this expedition that Linnaeus had a flash of insight regarding the classification of mammals. Upon observing the lower jawbone of a horse at the side of a road he was traveling, Linnaeus remarked: \"If I only knew how many teeth and of what kind every animal had, how many teats and where they were placed, I should perhaps be able to work out a perfectly natural system for the arrangement of all quadrupeds.\" Blunt (2001), p. 54.  DalarnaIn 1734, Linnaeus led a small group of students to Dalarna. Funded by the Governor of Dalarna, the expedition was to catalogue known natural resources and discover new ones, but also to gather intelligence on Norwegian mining activities at Røros.  European excursions DoctorateBack in Uppsala, Linnaeus\\' relations with Nils Rosén worsened, and thus he gladly accepted an invitation from the student Claes Sohlberg to spend the Christmas holiday in Falun with Sohlberg\\'s family. Sohlberg\\'s father was a mining inspector, and let Linnaeus visit the mines near Falun. Blunt (2001), p. 74.  Sohland\\'s father suggested to Linnaeus he should bring Sohlberg to the Dutch Republic and continue to tutor him there for an annual salary. At that time, the Dutch Republic was one of the most revered places to study natural history and a common place for Swedes to take their doctoral degree; Linnaeus, who was interested in both of these, accepted. Blunt (2001), pp. 78–79. In April 1735, Linnaeus and Sohlberg set out for the Netherlands, with Linnaeus to take a doctoral degree in medicine at the University of Harderwijk. Stöver (1974), p. 71.  On the way, they stopped in Hamburg, where they met the mayor, who proudly showed them a wonder of nature which he possessed: the taxidermied remains of a seven-headed hydra. Linnaeus quickly discovered it was a fake: jaws and clawed feet from weasels and skins from snakes had been glued together. The provenance of the hydra suggested to Linnaeus it had been manufactured by monks to represent the Beast of Revelation. As much as this may have upset the mayor, Linnaeus made his observations public and the mayor\\'s dreams of selling the hydra for an enormous sum were ruined. Fearing his wrath, Linnaeus and Sohlberg had to leave Hamburg quickly. Anderson (1997), pp. 60–61.  Blunt (2004), p. 90.  When Linnaeus reached Harderwijk, he began working toward a degree immediately; at the time, Harderwijk was known for awarding \"instant\" degrees after as little as a week.  First he handed in a thesis on the cause of malaria he had written in Sweden, which he then defended in a public debate. The next step was to take an oral examination and to diagnose a patient. After less than two weeks, he took his degree and became a doctor, at the age of 28.  Blunt (2001), p. 94.  During the summer, Linnaeus met a friend from Uppsala, Peter Artedi. Before their departure from Uppsala, Artedi and Linnaeus had decided should one of them die, the survivor would finish the other\\'s work. Ten weeks later, Artedi drowned in one of the canals of Amsterdam, and his unfinished manuscript on the classification of fish was left to Linnaeus to complete. Anderson (1997), p. 66.  Blunt (2004), pp. 98–100.  Publishing of  One of the first scientists Linnaeus met in the Netherlands was Johan Frederik Gronovius to whom Linnaeus showed one of the several manuscripts he had brought with him from Sweden. The manuscript described a new system for classifying plants. When Gronovius saw it, he was very impressed, and offered to help pay for the printing. With an additional monetary contribution by the Scottish doctor Isaac Lawson, the manuscript was published as  . Blunt (2001), p. 98.  Anderson (1997), pp. 62–63. Linnaeus became acquainted with one of the most respected physicians and botanists in the Netherlands, Herman Boerhaave, who tried to convince Linnaeus to make a career there. Boerhaave offered him a journey to South Africa and America, but Linnaeus declined, stating he would not stand the heat. Instead, Boerhaave convinced Linnaeus that he should visit the botanist Johannes Burman. After his visit, Burman, impressed with his guest\\'s knowledge, decided Linnaeus should stay with him during the winter. During his stay, Linnaeus helped Burman with his  . Burman also helped Linnaeus with the books on which he was working:   and  . Blunt (2004), pp. 100–102.  George Clifford In August, during Linnaeus\\' stay with Burman, he met George Clifford III, a director of the Dutch East India Company and the owner of a rich botanical garden at the estate of Hartekamp in Heemstede. Clifford was very impressed with Linnaeus\\' ability to classify plants, and invited him to become his physician and superintendent of his garden. Linnaeus had already agreed to stay with Burman over the winter, and could thus not accept immediately. However, Clifford offered to compensate Burman by offering him a copy of Sir Hans Sloane\\'s Natural History of Jamaica, a rare book, if he let Linnaeus stay with him, and Burman accepted. Anderson (1997), p. 64.  Stöver (1974), pp. 81–82.  On 24 September 1735, Linnaeus became the botanical curator and house physician at Hartekamp, free to buy any book or plant he wanted.In July 1736, Linnaeus travelled to England, at Clifford\\'s expense. Blunt (2001), pp. 106–107.  He went to London to visit Sir Hans Sloane, a collector of natural history, and to see his cabinet, Stöver (1974), p. 89.  as well as to visit the Chelsea Physic Garden and its keeper, Philip Miller. He taught Miller about his new system of subdividing plants, as described in  . Miller was impressed, and from then on started to arrange the garden according to Linnaeus\\' system. Stöver (1974), pp. 89–90.  Linnaeus also traveled to Oxford University to visit the botanist Johann Jacob Dillenius. He failed, however, to make Dillenius publicly accept his new classification system. He then returned to Hartekamp, bringing with him many specimens of rare plants. Stöver (1974), pp. 90–93.  The next year, he published  , in which he described 935 genera of plants, and shortly thereafter he supplemented it with  , with another sixty (sexaginta) genera. Stöver (1974), p. 95. His work at Hartekamp led to another book,  , a catalogue of the botanical holdings in the herbarium and botanical garden of Hartekamp. He wrote it in nine months (completed in July 1737), but it was not published until 1738.  It contains the first use of the name Nepenthes, which Linnaeus used to describe a genus of pitcher plants.  \"If this is not Helen\\'s Nepenthes, it certainly will be for all botanists. What botanist would not be filled with admiration if, after a long journey, he should find this wonderful plant. In his astonishment past ills would be forgotten when beholding this admirable work of the Creator!\" (translated from Latin by Harry Veitch) Linnaeus stayed with Clifford at Hartekamp until 18 October 1737 (new style), when he left the house to return to Sweden. Illness and the kindness of Dutch friends obliged him to stay some months longer in Holland. In May 1738, he set out for Sweden again. On the way home, he stayed in Paris for about a month, visiting botanists such as Antoine de Jussieu. After his return, Linnaeus never left Sweden again. Blunt (2001), p. 123.  Koerner (1999), p. 56.  Return to SwedenWhen Linnaeus returned to Sweden on 28 June 1738, he went to Falun, where he entered into an engagement to Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Three months later, he moved to Stockholm to find employment as a physician, and thus to make it possible to support a family.    Stöver (1974), p. 141.  Once again, Linnaeus found a patron; he became acquainted with Count Carl Gustav Tessin, who helped him get work as a physician at the Admiralty. Stöver (1974), pp. 146–147.  Koerner (1999), p. 16.  During this time in Stockholm, Linnaeus helped found the Royal Swedish Academy of Science; he became the first Praeses in the academy by drawing of lots. Koerner (1999), pp. 103–105. Because his finances had improved and were now sufficient to support a family, he received permission to marry his fiancée, Sara Elisabeth Moræa. Their wedding was held 26 June 1739. Seven months later, Sara gave birth to their first son, Carl. Two years later, a daughter, Elisabeth Christina, was born, and the subsequent year Sara gave birth to Sara Magdalena, who died 15 days old. Sara and Linnaeus would later have four other children: Lovisa, Sara Christina, Johannes and Sophia.  Stöver (1974), p. 382.  In May 1741, Linnaeus was appointed Professor of Medicine at Uppsala University, first with responsibility for medicine-related matters. Soon, he changed place with the other Professor of Medicine, Nils Rosén, and thus was responsible for the Botanical Garden (which he would thoroughly reconstruct and expand), botany and natural history, instead. In October that same year, his wife and nine-year-old son followed him to live in Uppsala. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 49–50.  Further exploration of Sweden Öland and GotlandTen days after he was appointed Professor, he undertook an expedition to the island provinces of Öland and Gotland with six students from the university, to look for plants useful in medicine. First, they travelled to Öland and stayed there until 21 June, when they sailed to Visby in Gotland. Linnaeus and the students stayed on Gotland for about a month, and then returned to Uppsala. During this expedition, they found 100 previously unrecorded plants. The observations from the expedition were later published in  , written in Swedish. Like  , it contained both zoological and botanical observations, as well as observations concerning the culture in Öland and Gotland. Koerner (1999), p. 115.  Blunt (2004), pp. 137–142. During the summer of 1745, Linnaeus published two more books:   and  .   was a strictly botanical book, while   was zoological.  Stöver (1974), pp. 117–118.  Anders Celsius had created the temperature scale named after him in 1742. Celsius\\' scale was inverted compared to today, the boiling point at 0 °C and freezing point at 100 °C. In 1745, Linnaeus inverted the scale to its present standard. Koerner (1999), p. 204.  VästergötlandIn the summer of 1746, Linnaeus was once again commissioned by the Government to carry out an expedition, this time to the Swedish province of Västergötland. He set out from Uppsala on 12 June and returned on 11 August. On the expedition his primary companion was Erik Gustaf Lidbeck, a student who had accompanied him on his previous journey. Linnaeus described his findings from the expedition in the book  , published the next year.  Blunt (2004), p. 159.  After returning from the journey the Government decided Linnaeus should take on another expedition to the southernmost province Scania. This journey was postponed, as Linnaeus felt too busy. In 1747, Linnaeus was given the title archiater, or chief physician, by the Swedish king Adolf Frederick—a mark of great respect. Blunt (2004), p. 165.  The same year he was elected member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin. Stöver (1974), p. 167.  ScaniaIn the spring of 1749, Linnaeus could finally journey to Scania, again commissioned by the Government. With him he brought his student, Olof Söderberg. On the way to Scania, he made his last visit to his brothers and sisters in Stenbrohult since his father had died the previous year. The expedition was similar to the previous journeys in most aspects, but this time he was also ordered to find the best place to grow walnut and Swedish whitebeam trees; these trees were used by the military to make rifles. The journey was successful, and Linnaeus\\' observations were published the next year in  . Blunt (2004), pp. 198–205.  Koerner (1999), p. 116.  Rector of Uppsala University In 1750, Linnaeus became rector of Uppsala University, starting a period where natural sciences were esteemed.  Perhaps the most important contribution he made during his time at Uppsala was to teach; many of his students travelled to various places in the world to collect botanical samples. Linnaeus called the best of these students his \"apostles\". Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 56–57.  His lectures were normally very popular and were often held in the Botanical Garden. He tried to teach the students to think for themselves and not trust anybody, not even him. Even more popular than the lectures were the botanical excursions made every Saturday during summer, where Linnaeus and his students explored the flora and fauna in the vicinity of Uppsala. Blunt (2004), pp. 173–174.  Publishing of  Linnaeus published   in 1751. The book contained a complete survey of the taxonomy system he had been using in his earlier works. It also contained information of how to keep a journal on travels and how to maintain a botanical garden. Blunt (2004), p. 221.  Publishing of  Linnaeus published  , the work which is now internationally accepted as the starting point of modern botanical nomenclature, in 1753. Stace (1991), p. 24.  The first volume was issued on 24 May, the second volume followed on 16 August  of the same year.The date of issue of both volumes was later, for practical purposes, arbitrarily set on 1 May, see Stearn, W.T. (1957), The preparation of the Species Plantarum and the introduction of binomial nomenclature, in: Species Plantarum, A Facsimile of the first edition, London, Ray Society: 72 and ICBN (Vienna Code) Art. 13.5: \"The two volumes of Linnaeus\\' Species plantarum, ed. 1 (1753), which appeared in May and August, 1753, respectively, are treated as having been published simultaneously on 1 May 1753.\"  The book contained 1,200 pages and was published in two volumes; it described over 7,300 species. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 47.  Stöver (1974), pp. 198–199.  The same year the king dubbed him knight of the Order of the Polar Star, the first civilian in Sweden to become a knight in this order. He was then seldom seen not wearing the order. Blunt (2004), p. 166.  EnnoblementLinnaeus felt Uppsala was too noisy and unhealthy, so he bought two farms in 1758: Hammarby and Sävja. The next year, he bought a neighbouring farm, Edeby. He spent the summers with his family at Hammarby; initially it only had a small one-storey house, but in 1762 a new, larger main building was added.  Blunt (2004), p. 219.  In Hammarby, Linnaeus made a garden where he could grow plants that could not be grown in the Botanical Garden in Uppsala. He began constructing a museum on a hill behind Hammarby in 1766, where he moved his library and collection of plants. A fire that destroyed about one third of Uppsala and had threatened his residence there necessitated the move. Blunt (2004), pp. 220–224. Since the initial release of   in 1735, the book had been expanded and reprinted several times; the tenth edition was released in 1758. This edition established itself as the starting point for zoological nomenclature, the equivalent of  .  Blunt (2004), p. 6. The Swedish king Adolf Frederick granted Linnaeus nobility in 1757, but he was not ennobled until 1761. With his ennoblement, he took the name Carl von Linné (Latinized as  ), \\'Linné\\' being a shortened and gallicised version of \\'Linnæus\\', and the German title \\'von\\' signifying his ennoblement.  The noble family\\'s coat of arms prominently features a twinflower, one of Linnaeus\\' favourite plants; it was given the scientific name Linnaea borealis in his honour by Gronovius. The shield in the coat of arms is divided into thirds: red, black and green for the three kingdoms of nature (animal, mineral and vegetable) in Linnaean classification; in the center is an egg \"to denote Nature, which is continued and perpetuated in ovo.\" At the bottom is a phrase in Latin, borrowed from the Aeneid, which reads \" \": we extend our fame by our deeds. Blunt (2004), p. 199.  Blunt (2004), pp. 229–230.  Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 62. After his ennoblement, Linnaeus continued teaching and writing. His reputation had spread over the world, and he corresponded with many different people. For example, Catherine II of Russia sent him seeds from her country. Uppsala University, Linné Online, English language version  He also corresponded with Giovanni Antonio Scopoli, \"the Linnaeus of the Austrian Empire\", who was a doctor and a botanist in Idrija, Duchy of Carniola (nowadays Slovenia).  Scopoli communicated all of his research, findings, and descriptions (for example of the olm and the dormouse, two little animals hitherto unknown to Linnaeus). Linnaeus greatly respected him and showed great interest in his work. He named a solanaceous genus, Scopolia, the source of scopolamine, after him. Because of a great distance, they didn\\'t ever meet.   Last yearsLinnaeus was relieved of his duties in the Royal Swedish Academy of Science in 1763, but continued his work there as usual for more than ten years after.  He stepped down as rector at Uppsala University in December 1772, mostly due to his declining health.  Blunt (2004), p. 245. Linnaeus\\' last years were troubled by illness. He had suffered from a disease called the Uppsala fever in 1764, but survived thanks to the care of Rosén. He developed sciatica in 1773, and the next year, he had a stroke which partially paralysed him. Blunt (2004), p. 232.  He suffered a second stroke in 1776, losing the use of his right side and leaving him bereft of his memory; while still able to admire his own writings, he could not recognize himself as their author. Stöver (1974), pp. 243–245.  Broberg (2006), p. 42. In December 1777, he had another stroke which greatly weakened him, and eventually led to his death on 10 January 1778 in Hammarby.  Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), p. 63.  Despite his desire to be buried in Hammarby, he was interred in Uppsala Cathedral on 22 January. Quammen (2007), p. 4.  Anderson (1997), pp. 104–106. His library and collections were left to his widow Sara and their children. Joseph Banks, an English botanist, wanted to buy the collection, but his son Carl refused and moved the collection to Uppsala. However, in 1783 Carl died and Sara inherited the collection, having outlived both her husband and son. She tried to sell it to Banks, but he was no longer interested; instead an acquaintance of his agreed to buy the collection. The acquaintance was a 24-year-old medical student, James Edward Smith, who bought the whole collection: 14,000 plants, 3,198 insects, 1,564 shells, about 3,000 letters and 1,600 books. Smith founded the Linnean Society of London five years later.  Blunt (2001), pp. 238–240. The von Linné name ended with his son Carl, who never married.  His other son, Johannes, had died aged 3.  There are over two hundred descendants of Linnaeus through two of his daughters.  Apostles  During Linnaeus\\' time as Professor and Rector of Uppsala University, he taught many devoted students, 17 of whom he called \"apostles\". They were the most promising, most committed students, and all of them made botanical expeditions to various places in the world, often with his help. The amount of this help varied; sometimes he used his influence as Rector to grant his apostles a scholarship or a place on an expedition. Blunt (2004), pp. 189–190.  To most of the apostles he gave instructions of what to look for on their journeys. Abroad, the apostles collected and organised new plants, animals and minerals according to Linnaeus\\' system. Most of them also gave some of their collection to Linnaeus when their journey was finished. Broberg (2006), pp. 37–39.  Thanks to these students, the Linnaean system of taxonomy spread through the world without Linnaeus ever having to travel outside Sweden after his return from Holland. Anderson (1997), pp. 92–93.  The British botanist William T. Stearn notes without Linnaeus\\' new system, it would not have been possible for the apostles to collect and organise so many new specimens. Blunt (2004), pp. 184–185.  Many of the apostles died during their expeditions. Early expeditionsChristopher Tärnström, the first apostle and a 43-year-old pastor with a wife and children, made his journey in 1746. He boarded a Swedish East India Company ship headed for China. Tärnström never reached his destination, dying of a tropical fever on Côn Sơn Island the same year. Tärnström\\'s widow blamed Linnaeus for making her children fatherless, causing Linnaeus to prefer sending out younger, unmarried students after Tärnström. Blunt (2004), pp. 185–186.  Six other apostles later died on their expeditions, including Pehr Forsskål and Pehr Löfling. Two years after Tärnström\\'s expedition, Finnish-born Pehr Kalm set out as the second apostle to North America. There he spent two-and-a-half years studying the flora and fauna of Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Canada. Linnaeus was overjoyed when Kalm returned, bringing back with him many pressed flowers and seeds. At least 90 of the 700 North American species described in Species Plantarum had been brought back by Kalm. Anderson (1997), pp. 93–94.  Cook expeditions and Japan Daniel Solander was living in Linnaeus\\' house during his time as a student in Uppsala. Linnaeus was very fond of him, promising Solander his oldest daughter\\'s hand in marriage. On Linnaeus\\' recommendation, Solander travelled to England in 1760, where he met the English botanist Joseph Banks. With Banks, Solander joined James Cook on his expedition to Oceania on the Endeavour in 1768–71. Anderson (1997), p. 96.  Blunt (2004), pp. 191–192.  Solander was not the only apostle to journey with James Cook; Anders Sparrman followed on the Resolution in 1772–75 bound for, among other places, Oceania and South America. Sparrman made many other expeditions, one of them to South Africa. Blunt (2004), pp. 192–193. Perhaps the most famous and successful apostle was Carl Peter Thunberg, who embarked on a nine-year expedition in 1770. He stayed in South Africa for three years, then travelled to Japan. All foreigners in Japan were forced to stay on the island of Dejima outside Nagasaki, so it was thus hard for Thunberg to study the flora. He did, however, manage to persuade some of the translators to bring him different plants, and he also found plants in the gardens of Dejima. He returned to Sweden in 1779, one year after Linnaeus\\' death. Blunt (2004), pp. 193–194.  Major publications  Systema Naturae The first edition of   was printed in the Netherlands in 1735. It was a twelve-page work. Linnaeus (1735)  By the time it reached its 10th edition in 1758, it classified 4,400 species of animals and 7,700 species of plants. In it, the unwieldy names mostly used at the time, such as \" \", were supplemented with concise and now familiar \"binomials\", composed of the generic name, followed by a specific epithet – in the case given, Physalis angulata. These binomials could serve as a label to refer to the species. Higher taxa were constructed and arranged in a simple and orderly manner. Although the system, now known as binomial nomenclature, was partially developed by the Bauhin brothers (see Gaspard Bauhin and Johann Bauhin) almost 200 years earlier,  Linnaeus was the first to use it consistently throughout the work, including in monospecific genera, and may be said to have popularised it within the scientific community.     (or, more fully,  ) was first published in 1753, as a two-volume work. Its prime importance is perhaps that it is the primary starting point of plant nomenclature as it exists today. In 1754, Linnaeus divided the plant Kingdom into 25 classes (Genera Plantarum 5th edition). One, Cryptogamia, included all the plants with concealed reproductive parts (algae, fungi, mosses and liverworts and ferns). Van den Hoek et al. (2005).      was first published in 1737, delineating plant genera. Around 10 editions were published, not all of them by Linnaeus himself; the most important is the 1754 fifth edition. Stace (1991), p. 22.      (1751) was a summary of Linnaeus\\' thinking on plant classification and nomenclature, and an elaboration of the work he had previously published in   (1736) and   (1737). Other publications forming part of his plan to reform the foundations of botany include his   and  : all were printed in Holland (as well as   (1737) and   (1735)), the Philosophia being simultaneously released in Stockholm.  Linnaean collectionsAt the end of his lifetime the Linnean collection in Uppsala was considered as one of the finest collections of natural history objects in Sweden. Next to his own collection he had also built up a museum for the university of Uppsala, which was supplied by material donated by Carl Gyllenborg (in 1744-1745), crown-prince Adolf Fredrik (in 1745), Erik Petreus (in 1746), Claes Grill (in 1746), Magnus Lagerström (in 1748 and 1750) and Jonas Alströmer (in 1749). The relation between the museum and the private collection was not formalized and the steady flow of material from Linnean pupils were incorporated to the private collection rather than to the museum. Wallin, L. 2001. Catalogue of type specimens. 4. Linnaean specimens. - pp. [1], 1-128. Uppsala. (Uppsala University, Museum of Evolution, Zoology Section). In April 1766 parts of the town were destroyed by a fire and the Linnean private collection was subsequently moved to a barn outside the town, and shortly afterwards to a single-room stone building close to his countryhouse at Hammarby near Uppsala. This resulted in a physical separation between the two collections, the museum collection remained in the botanical garden of the university. Some material which needed special care (alcohol specimens) or ample storage space was moved from the private collection to the museum.In Hammarby the Linnean private collections suffered seriously from damp and the depredations by mice and insects. Carl von Linné\\'s son (Carl Linnaeus) inherited the collections in 1778 and retained them until his own death in 1783. Shortly after Carl von Linné\\'s death his son confirmed that mice had caused \"horrible damage\" to the plants and that also moths and mould had caused considerable damage. Dance, S.P. 1967. Report on the Linnaean shell collection. - Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London 178 (1): 1-24, Pl. 1-10.  He tried to rescue them from the neglect they had suffered during his father\\'s later years, and also added further specimens. This last activity however reduced rather than augmented the scientific value of the original material.In 1784 the botanist James Edward Smith purchased from the inheritants (the widow and daughter of Carl Linnaeus) nearly all of the Linnean private scientific effects and transferred them to London.  Not all material in Linné\\'s private collection was transported to England. 33 fish specimens preserved in alcohol were not sent away and were later lost.In London Smith tended to neglect the zoological parts of the collection, he added some specimens and also gave some specimens away.  Over the following centuries the Linnean collection in London suffered enormously at the hands of scientists who studied the collection, and in the process disturbed the original arrangement and labels, added specimens that did not belong to the original series and withdrew precious original type material. Much material which had been intensively studied by Linné in his scientific career belonged to the collection of Queen Lovisa Ulrika (1720-1782) (in the Linnean publications referred to as \"Museum Ludovicae Ulricae\" or \"M. L. U.\"). This collection was donated by his grandson King Gustav IV Adolf (1778-1837) to the museum in Uppsala in 1804. Another important collection in this respect was that of her husband King Adolf Fredrik (1710-1771) (in the Linnean sources known as \"Museum Adolphi Friderici\" or \"Mus. Ad. Fr.\"), the wet parts (alcohol collection) of which were later donated to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, and is today housed in the Swedish Museum of Natural History at Stockholm. The dry material was transferred to Uppsala.  Linnaean taxonomy The establishment of universally accepted conventions for the naming of organisms was Linnaeus\\' main contribution to taxonomy—his work marks the starting point of consistent use of binomial nomenclature. Reveal & Pringle (1993), p. 160-161.  During the 18th century expansion of natural history knowledge, Linnaeus also developed what became known as the Linnaean taxonomy; the system of scientific classification now widely used in the biological sciences.The Linnaean system classified nature within a nested hierarchy, starting with three kingdoms. Kingdoms were divided into classes and they, in turn, into orders, and thence into genera (singular: genus), which were divided into Species (singular: species).  Below the rank of species he sometimes recognized taxa of a lower (unnamed) rank; these have since acquired standardised names such as variety in botany and subspecies in zoology.  Modern taxonomy includes a rank of family between order and genus that was not present in Linnaeus\\' original system. Davis & Heywood (1973), p. 17. Linnaeus\\' groupings were based upon shared physical characteristics, and not simply upon differences.  Of his higher groupings, only those for animals are still in use, and the groupings themselves have been significantly changed since their conception, as have the principles behind them. Nevertheless, Linnaeus is credited with establishing the idea of a hierarchical structure of classification which is based upon observable characteristics and intended to reflect natural relationships.   While the underlying details concerning what are considered to be scientifically valid \"observable characteristics\" have changed with expanding knowledge (for example, DNA sequencing, unavailable in Linnaeus\\' time, has proven to be a tool of considerable utility for classifying living organisms and establishing their evolutionary relationships), the fundamental principle remains sound. Views on mankindAccording to German biologist Ernst Haeckel, the question of man\\'s origin began with Linnaeus. He helped future research in the natural history of man by describing humans just as he described any other plant or animal. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 156–157.  He was the first person to place humans in a system of biological classification .   AnthropomorphaLinnaeus classified humans among the primates (as they were later called) beginning with the first edition of  . During his time at Hartekamp, he had the opportunity to examine several monkeys and noted similarities between them and man. Gribbin & Gribbin (2008), pp. 173–174.  He pointed out both species basically have the same anatomy; except for speech, he found no other differences. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 170.  Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 167, quotes Linnaeus explaining the real difference would necessarily be absent from his classification system, as it was not a morphological characteristic: \"I well know what a splendidly great difference there is [between] a man and a bestia [literally, \"beast\"; that is, a non-human animal] when I look at them from a point of view of morality. Man is the animal which the Creator has seen fit to honor with such a magnificent mind and has condescended to adopt as his favorite and for which he has prepared a nobler life\". See also books.google.com in which Linnaeus cites the significant capacity to reason as the distinguishing characteristic of humans.  Thus he placed man and monkeys under the same category, Anthropomorpha, meaning \"manlike.\" Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 167.  This classification received criticism from other biologists such as Johan Gottschalk Wallerius, Jacob Theodor Klein and Johann Georg Gmelin on the ground that it is illogical to describe a human as \\'like a man\\'.  In a letter to Gmelin from 1747, Linnaeus replied:    It does not please [you] that I\\'ve placed Man among the Anthropomorpha, perhaps because of the term \\'with human form\\', \"antropomorphon\"    but man learns to know himself. Let\\'s not quibble over words. It will be the same to me whatever name we apply. But I seek from you and from the whole world a generic difference between man and simian that [follows] from the principles of Natural History. Others who followed were more inclined to give humans a special place in classification; Johann Friedrich Blumenbach in the first edition of his Manual of Natural History (1779), proposed that the primates be divided into the Quadrumana (four-handed, i.e. apes and monkeys) and Bimana (two-handed, i.e. humans). This distinction was taken up by other naturalists, most notably Georges Cuvier. Some elevated the distinction to the level of order. However, the many affinities between humans and other primates – and especially the great apes – made it clear that the distinction made no scientific sense. Charles Darwin wrote, in The Descent of Man in 1871:    The greater number of naturalists who have taken into consideration the whole structure of man, including his mental faculties, have followed Blumenbach and Cuvier, and have placed man in a separate Order, under the title of the Bimana, and therefore on an equality with the orders of the Quadrumana, Carnivora, etc. Recently many of our best naturalists have recurred to the view first propounded by Linnaeus, so remarkable for his sagacity, and have placed man in the same Order with the Quadrumana, under the title of the Primates. The justice of this conclusion will be admitted: for in the first place, we must bear in mind the comparative insignificance for classification of the great development of the brain in man, and that the strongly marked differences between the skulls of man and the Quadrumana (lately insisted upon by Bischoff, Aeby, and others) apparently follow from their differently developed brains. In the second place, we must remember that nearly all the other and more important differences between man and the Quadrumana are manifestly adaptive in their nature, and relate chiefly to the erect position of man; such as the structure of his hand, foot, and pelvis, the curvature of his spine, and the position of his head.   I absolutely know of none. If only someone might tell me a single one! If I would have called man a simian or vice versa, I would have brought together all the theologians against me. Perhaps I ought to have by virtue of the law of the discipline. The theological concerns were twofold: first, putting man at the same level as monkeys or apes would lower the spiritually higher position that man was assumed to have in the great chain of being, and second, because the Bible says man was created in the image of God  (theomorphism), if monkeys/apes and humans were not distinctly and separately designed, that would mean monkeys and apes were created in the image of God as well. This was something many could not accept. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 171–172.  The conflict between world views based on science and theology that was caused by asserting man was a type of animal would simmer for a century until the much greater, and still ongoing, creation–evolution controversy began in earnest with the publication of On the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859.After such criticism, Linnaeus felt he needed to explain himself more clearly. The 10th edition of   introduced new terms, including Mammalia and Primates, the latter of which would replace Anthropomorpha Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 175.  as well as giving humans the full binomial Homo sapiens. Blunt (2004), p. 8.  The new classification received less criticism, but many natural historians still believed he had demoted humans from their former place to rule over nature, not be a part of it. Linnaeus believed that man biologically belongs to the animal kingdom and had to be included in it. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 191–192.  In his book  , he said, \"One should not vent one\\'s wrath on animals, Theology decree that man has a soul and that the animals are mere \\'aoutomata mechanica,\\' but I believe they would be better advised that animals have a soul and that the difference is of nobility.\" Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 166.    Strange people in distant landsLinnaeus added a second species to the genus Homo in   based on a figure and description by Jacobus Bontius from a 1658 publication: Homo troglodytes (\"caveman\")  Bontius (1658), p. 84.  and published a third in 1771: Homo lar.  Swedish historian Gunnar Broberg states that the new human species Linnaeus described were actually simians or native people clad in skins to frighten colonial settlers, whose appearance had been exaggerated in accounts to Linnaeus. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 187. In early editions of  , many well-known legendary creatures were included such as the phoenix, dragon and manticore as well as cryptids like the satyrus, Linnaeus is translated, writing that the satyrus is \"hairy, bearded, with a manlike body, gesticulating much, very fallacious, is a species of monkey, if ever one has been seen.\" which Linnaeus collected into the catch-all category Paradoxa. Broberg thought Linnaeus was trying to offer a natural explanation and demystify the world of superstition. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), pp. 176–177.  Linnaeus tried to debunk some of these creatures, as he had with the hydra; regarding the purported remains of dragons, Linnaeus wrote that they were either derived from lizards or rays.  For Homo troglodytes he asked the Swedish East India Company to search for one, but they did not find any signs of its existence. Frängsmyr et al. (1983), p. 186.  Homo lar has since been reclassified as Hylobates lar, the lar gibbon.    Four races In the first edition of  , Linnaeus subdivided the human species into four varieties based on continent and skin colour: \"Europæus albus\" (white European), \"Americanus rubescens\" (red American), \"Asiaticus fuscus\" (brown Asian) and \"Africanus niger\" (black African). In the tenth edition of Systema Naturae he further detailed stereotypical characteristics for each variety, based on the concept of the four temperaments from classical antiquity, and changed the description of Asians\\' skin tone to \"luridus\" (yellow).      Additionally, Linnaeus created a wastebasket taxon \"monstrosus\" for \"wild and monstrous humans, unknown groups, and more or less abnormal people\".  Commemoration  Anniversaries of Linnaeus\\' birth, especially in centennial years, have been marked by major celebrations. Östholm (2007)  Linnaeus has appeared on numerous Swedish postage stamps and banknotes.  There are numerous statues of Linnaeus in countries around the world. The Linnean Society of London has awarded the Linnean Medal for excellence in botany or zoology since 1888. Following approval by the Parliament of Sweden, Växjö University and Kalmar College merged on 1 January 2010 to become Linnaeus University.  Other things named after Linnaeus include the twinflower genus Linnaea, the crater Linné on the Earth\\'s moon and the cobalt sulfide mineral Linnaeite. Commentary on LinnaeusAndrew Dickson White wrote in   (1896):   Linnaeus... was the most eminent naturalist of his time, a wide observer, a close thinker; but the atmosphere in which he lived and moved and had his being was saturated with biblical theology, and this permeated all his thinking. ...Toward the end of his life he timidly advanced the hypothesis that all the species of one genus constituted at the creation one species; and from the last edition of his Systema Naturæ he quietly left out the strongly orthodox statement of the fixity of each species, which he had insisted upon in his earlier works. ...warnings came speedily both from the Catholic and Protestant sides.

Congo was settled in the 7th and 8th centuries A.D. by Bantus from present-day Nigeria. During its history the area has also been known as Congo, Congo Free State, Belgian Congo and Zaire. The Kingdom of Kongo was a powerful kingdom that existed from the 14th to the 18th century. It was the dominant force in the region until the arrival of the Portuguese. Second in importance was the Anziku Kingdom. Belgian colonization Congo Free State (1885–1908)  The Congo Free State was a corporate state privately controlled by Leopold II of Belgium through the Association Internationale Africaine, a non-governmental organization. Leopold was the sole shareholder and chairman. The state included the entire area of the present Democratic Republic of the Congo. Under Leopold II\\'s administration, the Congo Free State became the site of one of the most infamous international scandals of the turn of the twentieth century. The report of the British Consul Roger Casement led to the arrest and punishment of white officials who had been responsible for cold-blooded killings during a rubber-collecting expedition in 1903, including one Belgian national for causing the shooting of at least 122 Congolese natives. Estimates of the total death toll vary considerably. In the absence of a census, the first was made in 1924, it is even more difficult to quantify the population loss of the period. Roger Casement\\'s famous 1904 report estimated ten million people. According to Casement\\'s report, indiscriminate \"war\", starvation, reduction of births and tropical diseases caused the country\\'s depopulation.  The European and U.S. press agencies exposed the conditions in the Congo Free State to the public in 1900. By 1908 public and diplomatic pressure led Leopold II to annex the Congo as the Belgian Congo colony.  Belgian Congo (1908–1960)  On 15 November 1908 King Léopold II of Belgium formally relinquished personal control of the Congo Free State. The renamed Belgian Congo came under the administration of the Belgian parliament, which lasted until independence was granted in 1960. The Belgian administration might be most charitably characterized as paternalistic colonialism. Roman Catholic and Protestant churches dominated the education system and the curricula reflected Christian and Western values. In 1948 Christian missions controlled 99.6% of educational facilities. They had little regard for native culture and beliefs. Native schools provided a mainly religious and vocational education.  The Congo Crisis (1960–1965)  Following riots in Leopoldville between 4–7 January 1959, and Stanleyville on 31 October 1959, the Belgians realised they could not maintain control of such a vast country in the face of rising demands for independence. The Belgians and Congolese political leaders held a Round Table Conference in Brussels beginning on 18 January 1960. At the end of the Conference on 27 January 1960 it was announced that elections would be held in the Congo on 22 May 1960, and full independence granted on 30 June 1960. The Congo was indeed granted its independence on 30 June 1960, adopting the name \"Republic of the Congo\" (République du Congo).  As the French colony of Middle Congo (Moyen Congo) also chose the name Republic of Congo upon receiving its independence, the two countries were more commonly known as Congo-Léopoldville and Congo-Brazzaville, after their capital cities. President Mobutu changed the country\\'s official name to Zaire in 1966. In 1960, the country was in a very unstable state—regional tribal leaders held far more power than the central government—and with the departure of the Belgian administrators, there were almost no skilled bureaucrats left in the country. The first Congolese university graduate was only in 1956, and virtually no one in the new nation had any idea of how to manage a country of such size.Parliamentary elections in 1960 produced the nationalist Patrice Lumumba as prime minister and pro-Western Joseph Kasavubu as president of the renamed Democratic Republic of the Congo.Even from this fleeting moment of independence democracy began to unravel. On 5 July 1960 a military mutiny by Congolese soldiers against their European officers broke out in the capital and rampant looting began. On 11 July 1960 the richest province of the country, Katanga, seceded under Moise Tshombe. The United Nations sent 20,000 peacekeepers to protect Europeans in the country and try to restore order. Western paramilitaries and mercenaries, often hired by mining companies to protect their interests, also began to pour into the country. In this same period Congo\\'s second richest province, Kasai, also announced its independence on 8 August 1960.Prime Minister Lumumba turned to the USSR for assistance. Nikita Khrushchev agreed to help, offering advanced weaponry and technical advisors.  The United States viewed the Soviet presence as an attempt to take advantage of the situation and gain a proxy state in sub-Saharan Africa. UN forces were ordered to block any shipments of arms into the country. The United States also looked for a way to replace Lumumba as leader. President Kasavubu had clashed with Prime Minister Lumumba and advocated an alliance with the West rather than the Soviets. The U.S. sent weapons and CIA personnel to aid forces allied with Kasavubu and combat the Soviet presence. On 14 September 1960, with U.S. and CIA support, Colonel Joseph Mobutu overthrew the government and arrested Lumumba. On 17 January 1961 Mobutu sent Lumumba to Élisabethville (now Lubumbashi), capital of Katanga. In full view of the press he was beaten and forced to eat copies of his own speeches. For the next three weeks, he was not seen or heard from. Then Katangan radio announced implausibly that he had escaped and been killed by some villagers. In fact he had been tortured and killed along with two others shortly after his arrival. It was soon clear that he had been murdered in custody. In 2001, a Belgian inquiry established that he had been shot by Katangan gendarmes in the presence of Belgian officers, under Katangan command. Lumumba was beaten, placed in front of a firing squad with 2 other allies, cut up, buried, dug up and what remained was dissolved in acid. In Stanleyville, those loyal to the deposed Lumumba set up a rival government under Antoine Gizenga which lasted from 31 March 1961 until it was reintegrated on 5 August 1961. After some reverses, UN and Congolese government forces succeeded in recapturing the breakaway provinces of South Kasai on 30 December 1961, and Katanga on 15 January 1963.A new crisis erupted in the Simba Rebellion of 1964-1965 which saw half the country taken by the rebels. European mercenaries, US, and Belgian troops were called in by the Congolese government to defeat the rebellion. Zaire (1965–1996)  Unrest and rebellion plagued the government until 1965, when Lieutenant General Mobutu, by then commander in chief of the national army, seized control of the country and declared himself president for five years. Mobutu quickly consolidated his power and was elected unopposed as president in 1970. Embarking on a campaign of cultural awareness, Mobutu renamed the country the Republic of Zaire and required citizens to adopt African names. Relative peace and stability prevailed until 1977 and 1978 when Katangan rebels, based in Angola, launched a series of invasions (Shaba I and II) into the Shaba (Katanga) region. The rebels were driven out with the aid of Belgian paratroopers.Zaire remained a one-party state in the 1980s. Although Mobutu successfully maintained control during this period, opposition parties, most notably the Union pour la Démocratie et le Progrès Social (UDPS), were active. Mobutu\\'s attempts to quell these groups drew significant international criticism. As the Cold War came to a close, internal and external pressures on Mobutu increased. In late 1989 and early 1990, Mobutu was weakened by a series of domestic protests, by heightened international criticism of his regime\\'s human rights practices, by a faltering economy, and by government corruption, most notably his massive embezzlement of government funds for personal use. In April 1990, Mobutu declared the Third Republic, agreeing to a limited multi-party system with elections and a constitution. As details of a reform package were delayed, soldiers in September 1991 began looting Kinshasa to protest their unpaid wages. Two thousand French and Belgian troops, some of whom were flown in on U.S. Air Force planes, arrived to evacuate the 20,000 endangered foreign nationals in Kinshasa. In 1992, after previous similar attempts, the long-promised Sovereign National Conference was staged, encompassing over 2,000 representatives from various political parties. The conference gave itself a legislative mandate and elected Archbishop Laurent Monsengwo as its chairman, along with Étienne Tshisekedi wa Mulumba, leader of the UDPS, as prime minister. By the end of the year Mobutu had created a rival government with its own prime minister. The ensuing stalemate produced a compromise merger of the two governments into the High Council of Republic-Parliament of Transition (HCR-PT) in 1994, with Mobutu as head of state and Kengo Wa Dondo as prime minister. Although presidential and legislative elections were scheduled repeatedly over the next two years, they never took place.  First Congo War (1996–1997)  By 1996, tensions from the neighboring Rwanda war and genocide had spilled over to Zaire: see History of Rwanda. Rwandan Hutu militia forces (Interahamwe), who had fled Rwanda following the ascension of a Tutsi-led government, had been using Hutu refugees camps in eastern Zaire as a basis for incursion against Rwanda. These Hutu militia forces soon allied with the Zairian armed forces (FAZ) to launch a campaign against Congolese ethnic Tutsis in eastern Zaire. In turn, these Tutsis formed a militia to defend themselves against attacks. When the Zairian government began to escalate its massacres in November 1996, the Tutsi militias erupted in rebellion against Mobutu. The Tutsi militia was soon joined by various opposition groups and supported by several countries, including Rwanda and Uganda. This coalition, led by Laurent-Desire Kabila, became known as the Alliance des Forces Démocratiques pour la Libération du Congo-Zaïre (AFDL). The AFDL, now seeking the broader goal of ousting Mobutu, made significant military gains in early 1997. They were soon joined by various Zairean politicians, who had been unsuccessfully opposing the dictatorship of Mobutu for many years, and now saw an opportunity for them in the invasion of Zaire by two of the region\\'s strongest military forces. Following failed peace talks between Mobutu and Kabila in May 1997, Mobutu left the country, and Kabila marched unopposed to Kinshasa on 20 May. Kabila named himself president, consolidated power around himself and the AFDL, and reverted the name of the country to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Second Congo War (1998–2003)  Kabila demonstrated little ability to manage the problems of his country, and lost his allies. To counterbalance the power and influence of Rwanda in DRC, the Ugandan troops instigated the creation of another rebel movement called the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), led by the Congolese warlord Jean-Pierre Bemba. They attacked in August 1998, backed by Rwandan and Ugandan troops. Soon afterwards, Angola, Namibia, and Zimbabwe became involved militarily in the Congo, with Angola and Zimbabwe supporting the government. While the six African governments involved in the war signed a ceasefire accord in Lusaka in July 1999, the Congolese rebels did not and the ceasefire broke down within months. However, Kabila was assassinated in 2001 by one of his bodyguards and was succeeded by his son, Joseph. Upon taking office, Kabila called for multilateral peace talks to end the war. Kabila partly succeeded when a further peace deal was brokered between him, Uganda, and Rwanda leading to the apparent withdrawal of foreign troops.Currently, the Ugandans and the MLC still hold a   wide section of the north of the country; Rwandan forces and its front, the Rassemblement Congolais pour la Démocratie (RCD) control a large section of the east; and government forces or their allies hold the west and south of the country. There were reports that the conflict is being prolonged as a cover for extensive looting of the substantial natural resources in the country, including diamonds, copper, zinc, and coltan. The conflict was reignited in January 2002 by ethnic clashes in the northeast and both Uganda and Rwanda then halted their withdrawal and sent in more troops. Talks between Kabila and the rebel leaders, held in Sun City, lasted a full six weeks, beginning in April 2002. In June, they signed a peace accord in which Kabila would share power with former rebels. By June 2003, all foreign armies except those of Rwanda had pulled out of Congo. Few people in the Congo  have been unaffected by the armed conflict. A survey conducted in 2009 by the ICRC and Ipsos shows that three quarters (76%) of the people interviewed have been affected in some way–either personally or due to the wider consequences of armed conflict. The response of the international community has been incommensurate with the scale of the disaster resulting from the war in the Congo. Its support for political and diplomatic efforts to end the war has been relatively consistent, but it has taken no effective steps to abide by repeated pledges to demand accountability for the war crimes and crimes against humanity that were routinely committed in Congo. United Nations Security Council and the U.N. Secretary-General have frequently denounced human rights abuses and the humanitarian disaster that the war unleashed on the local population. But they had shown little will to tackle the responsibility of occupying powers for the atrocities taking place in areas under their control, areas where the worst violence in the country took place. Hence Rwanda, like Uganda, has escaped any significant sanction for its role.  Transitional government (2003–2006)  DR Congo had a transitional government in July 2003 until the election was over. A constitution was approved by voters and on 30 July 2006 the Congo held its first multi-party elections since independence in 1960. After this Joseph Kabila took 45% of the votes and his opponent Jean-Pierre Bemba took 20%. That was the origin of a fight between the two parts from  20–22 August 2006 in the streets of the capital, Kinshasa. Sixteen people died before policemen and UN mission MONUC took control of the city. A new election was held on 29 October 2006, which Kabila won with 70% of the vote. Bemba has publicly commented on election \"irregularities,\" despite the fact that every neutral observer has praised the elections. On 6 December 2006 the Transitional Government came to an end as Joseph Kabila was sworn in as President. Continued conflictsThe fragility of the state has allowed continued violence and human rights abuses in the east. There are three significant centers of conflict.Ituri, where MONUC has proved unable to contain the numerous militia and groups driving the Ituri conflictNorthern Katanga, where Mai-Mai created by Laurent Kabila slipped out of the control of Kinshasa.In October 2009 a new conflict started in Dongo, Sud-Ubangi District where clashes had broken out over access to fishing ponds. Kivu conflict  North Kivu and South Kivu, where Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR) continues to threaten the Rwandan border and the Banyamulenge, Rwanda supported RCD-Goma rebels (see Kivu war).In April 2012, ethnic Tutsi soldiers mutinied against the government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mutineers formed a rebel group called the March 23 Movement (M23), composed of former members of the rebel National Congress for the Defence of the People (CNDP). On 20 November 2012, M23 took control of Goma, a provincial capital with a population of one million people.  Re-election of Joseph KabilaOn December 2011, Joseph Kabila was re-elected for a second term as president. After the results were announced on 9 December, there was violent unrest in Kinshasa and Mbuji-Mayi, where official tallies showed that a strong majority had voted for the opposition candidate Etienne Tshisekedi.  Official observers from the Carter Center reported that returns from almost 2,000 polling stations in areas where support for Tshisekedi was strong had been lost and not included in the official results. They described the election as lacking credibility.   On 20 December, Kabila was sworn in for a second term, promising to invest in infrastructure and public services. However, Tshisekedi maintained that the result of the election was illegitimate and said that he intended also to \"swear himself in\" as president.

Sweeney, p.1  It concludes a series of books running from Joshua through Judges and Samuel, which make up the section of the Hebrew Bible called the Former Prophets. This series is also often referred to as the Deuteronomistic history, a body of writing which scholars believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the Jewish kingdom by Babylon in 586\\xa0BCE and a foundation for a return from exile.  Contents See 1 Kings and 2 Kings at Bible GatewayDavid dies and Solomon comes to the throne. At the beginning of his reign he assumes God\\'s promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people.  The centrepiece of Solomon\\'s reign is the building of the First Temple: the claim that this took place 480 years after the Exodus from Egypt marks it as a key event in Israel\\'s history.  At the end, however, he follows other gods and oppresses Israel. As a consequence of Solomon\\'s failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than Yahweh, the kingdom of David is split in two in the reign of his own son Rehoboam, who becomes the first to reign over the kingdom of Judah.  The kings who follow Rehoboam in Jerusalem continue the royal line of David (i.e., they inherit the promise to David); in the north, however, dynasties follow each other in rapid succession, and the kings are uniformly bad (meaning that they fail to follow Yahweh alone). At length God brings the Assyrians to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise.Hezekiah, the 14th king of Judah \"did what was right in the eyes of the Lord\" and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods. Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria. But Manasseh, the next king, reverses the reforms,  and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king. Mannasah\\'s righteous grandson Josiah reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess Huldah, affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed. God brings the Babylonians against Jerusalem; Yahweh deserts his people, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity. (The final verses record how Jehoiachin, the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon). Composition Textual historyIn the original Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by Jews) First and Second Kings were a single book, as were First and Second Samuel. When this was translated into Greek in the last few centuries BCE, Kings was joined with Samuel in a four-part work called the Book of Kingdoms. The Greek Orthodox branch of Christianity continues to use the Greek translation (the Septuagint), but when a Latin translation (called the Vulgate) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually both Kings and Samuel were separated into two books each.  The Deuteronomistic historyAccording to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was Jeremiah, whose life overlapped the fall of Jerusalem in 586\\xa0BCE.  The most common view today accepts Martin Noth\\'s thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the Book of Deuteronomy, and which biblical scholars therefore call the Deuteronomistic history.  Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers,  a first edition from the time of Josiah (late 7th century), promoting Josiah\\'s religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from  the mid 6th century. Fretheim, p.7  Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century edition pointing to Hezekiah of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century version with a similar message but identifying Jehu of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being.  SourcesThe editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a \"Book of the Acts of Solomon\" and, frequently, the \"Annals of the Kings of Judah\" and a separate book, \"Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\". The \"Deuteronomic\" perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon\\'s speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example.  The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda,  but in the broadest sense they appear to have been: 1 Kings 1-2: The end of the \"court history of David\" (also called the Succession Narrative), which also constitutes most of 2 Samuel 9-20. For the rest of Solomon\\'s reign the text names its source as \"the book of the acts of Solomon\", but other sources were employed, and much was added by the redactor. Israel and Judah: The two \"chronicles\" of Israel and Judah provided the chronological framework, but few details apart from the succession of monarchs and the account of how the Temple of Solomon was progressively stripped as true religion declined. A third source, or set of sources, were cycles of stories about various prophets (Elijah and Elisha, Isaiah, Ahijah and Micaiah), plus a few smaller miscellaneous traditions. The conclusion of the book (2 Kings 25:18-21, 27-30) was probably based on personal knowledge. A few sections were editorial additions not based on sources. These include various predictions of the downfall of the northern kingdom, the equivalent prediction of the downfall of Judah following the reign of Manasseh, the extension of Josiah\\'s reforms in accordance with the laws of Deuteronomy, and the revision of the narrative from Jeremiah concerning Judah\\'s last days.  Themes and genreKings is \"history-like,\" but it mixes legends, folktales, miracle stories and fiction in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God\\'s offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history.  The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the temple in Jerusalem (none do, and therefore all are \"evil\"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the \"high places\" (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to  important and successful kings like Omri and Jeroboam II and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel\\'s history, the battle of Qarqar.  The major themes of Kings are God\\'s promise, the recurrent apostasy of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel:  Promise: In return for Israel\\'s promise to worship Yahweh alone, Yahweh makes promises to David and to Israel - to David, the promise that his line will rule Israel forever, to Israel, the promise of the land they will possess. Apostasy: the great tragedy of Israel\\'s history, meaning the destruction of the kingdom and the Temple, is due to the failure of the people, but more especially the kings, to worship Yahweh alone (Yahweh being the god of Israel). Judgement: Apostasy leads to judgement. Judgement is not punishment, but simply the natural (or rather, God-ordained) consequence of Israel\\'s failure to worship Yahweh alone. Another and related theme is that of prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God\\'s prophecies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.  Textual features ChronologyThe standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology.  To take just a single example, Omri\\'s accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of Asa of Judah (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor Zimri in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15).  The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version.  A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none have achieved consensus status.  Kings and 2 Chronicles2 Chronicles covers much the same time-period as Kings, but it ignores the northern kingdom of Israel almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, Hezekiah is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and Manasseh is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign. Sutherland, p.247  It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and re-wrote history as he would have liked it to have been.

Based on the DC Comics character of the same name, the film stars Michael Keaton in the title role, as well as Jack Nicholson, Kim Basinger, Robert Wuhl, Michael Gough, Pat Hingle, Billy Dee Williams, and Jack Palance. The film, in which Batman deals with the rise of a costumed criminal known as \"The Joker\" (Nicholson), was the first installment of Warner Bros.\\' initial Batman film series.After Burton was hired as director, Steve Englehart and Julie Hickson wrote film treatments before Sam Hamm wrote the first screenplay. Batman was not greenlit until after the success of Burton\\'s Beetlejuice (1988). Numerous A-list actors were considered for the role of Batman. Nicholson accepted the role of the Joker under strict conditions that dictated a high salary, a portion of the box office profits, and his shooting schedule.Filming took place at Pinewood Studios from October 1988 to January 1989. The budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million, while the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike forced Hamm to drop out. Uncredited rewrites were performed by Warren Skaaren, Charles McKeown and Jonathan Gems. Batman was a critical and financial success, earning over $400 million in box office totals. The film received several Saturn Award nominations and a Golden Globe nomination, and won an Academy Award. It was also inspired the equally successful Batman: The Animated Series, paving the way for the DC animated universe, and has influenced Hollywood\\'s modern marketing and development techniques of the superhero film genre.The film marked the beginning of a Batman film series, with three sequels Batman Returns (1992), Batman Forever (1995), and Batman & Robin (1997) released, the latter two were directed by Joel Schumacher  instead of Burton. The film series was rebooted in 2005 with Batman Begins, directed by Christopher Nolan. PlotAs a child, Bruce Wayne (Michael Keaton) witnesses his parents killed by a criminal. He vows to avenge their deaths in a lifelong battle against crime in the guise of Batman while concealing his secret identity, adopting the public face of a billionaire playboy and head of Wayne Enterprises. Years later, Gotham City is controlled by crime boss Carl Grissom (Jack Palance). Despite the best efforts of newly-elected district attorney Harvey Dent (Billy Dee Williams) and police commissioner James Gordon (Pat Hingle), the Gotham City Police Department remains corrupt. Reporter Alexander Knox (Robert Wuhl) and photojournalist Vicki Vale (Kim Basinger) begin investigating the rumors of a shadowy vigilante figure dressed as a bat who has been fighting criminals throughout the city.Vicki and Knox attend a benefit at Wayne Manor, where Bruce is taken by Vicki\\'s charms and spends the night with her. That same night, Grissom\\'s second in command, Jack Napier (Jack Nicholson), is sent to raid the Axis Chemicals factory. After the police receive a tip-off and arrive to arrest him, Napier realizes he has been set up by his boss as revenge for his affair with Grissom\\'s mistress. In the midst of the shoot-out, Batman arrives and takes out Napier\\'s henchmen. In the ensuing struggle, Napier shoots at Batman, who deflects the bullet with his metal-reinforced gauntlet and sends it back in Napier\\'s face, tearing it open. Reeling from the pain, Napier topples over a platform rail and falls into a vat of chemicals, even as Batman tries to save him. The chemicals and a botched attempt at plastic surgery leave him with chalk white skin, red lips, green hair, and a permanent rictal grin. Driven insane by his reflection, he reinvents himself as \"the Joker\", a master criminal and \"homicidal artist\".After killing Grissom, the Joker takes over his empire and holds the city at his mercy by chemically altering everyday hygiene products, causing those using a certain combination of products to laugh to death. Batman attempts to track down the Joker, who has become obsessed with Vicki. During an encounter with the Joker, Batman recognizes him as the criminal who murdered his parents. Bruce\\'s butler, Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Gough), lets Vicki into the Batcave, where she tells Bruce she is in love with him. Bruce promises to pursue a relationship with her after he has defeated the Joker. Batman destroys the factory the Joker used to make the poisoned products and creates an antidote. The Joker holds a parade through Gotham, luring its citizens on to its streets by dispensing money, intending to kill them with lethal gas. Batman foils his plan, but the Joker kidnaps Vicki and takes her to the top of a cathedral church. After a fight with Batman, the Joker tries to escape on a helicopter, but Batman uses a grappling hook to snare the Joker\\'s legs to a gargoyle; the Joker falls to his death when the gargoyle breaks loose of its moorings. Commissioner Gordon unveils the Bat-Signal along with a note from Batman read by Harvey Dent, promising to defend Gotham whenever crime strikes again. Cast Michael Keaton as Bruce Wayne/Batman Jack Nicholson as Jack Napier/The Joker Kim Basinger as Vicki Vale Michael Gough as Alfred Pennyworth Tracey Walter as Bob Robert Wuhl as Alexander Knox Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent Jack Palance as Carl Grissom Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt Production Development   After the financial success of Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure (1985), Warner Bros. hired Tim Burton to direct Batman. Burton had then-girlfriend Julie Hickson write a new 30-page film treatment, feeling the previous script by Tom Mankiewicz was campy. The success of The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke rekindled Warner Bros.\\' interest in a film adaptation. Burton was initially not a comic book fan, but he was impressed by the dark and serious tone found in both The Dark Knight Returns and The Killing Joke.  Warner Bros. enlisted the aid of Steve Englehart to write a new treatment in March 1986.    It included the Joker and Rupert Thorne as the main villains, with a cameo appearance by the Penguin. Silver St. Cloud and Dick Grayson were key supporting roles. It followed the similar storyline from Englehart\\'s own Strange Apparitions (ISBN 1-56389-500-5). Warner Bros. was impressed, but Englehart felt there were too many characters. He removed the Penguin and Dick Grayson in his second treatment, finishing in May 1986. Burton approached Sam Hamm, a comic book fan, to write the screenplay.    Hamm decided not to use an origin story, feeling that flashbacks would be more suitable and that \"unlocking the mystery\" would become part of the storyline.    He reasoned, \"You totally destroy your credibility if you show the literal process by which Bruce Wayne becomes Batman.\"    Hamm replaced Silver St. Cloud with Vicki Vale and Rupert Thorne with his own creation, Carl Grissom. He completed his script in October 1986, which demoted Dick Grayson to a cameo rather than a supporting character.  One scene in Hamm\\'s script had a young James Gordon on duty the night of the murder of Bruce Wayne\\'s parents. When Hamm\\'s script was rewritten, the scene was deleted but retaken to Batman Begins. Warner Bros. was less willing to move forward on development, despite their enthusiasm for Hamm\\'s script, which Batman co-creator Bob Kane greeted with positive feedback.  Hamm\\'s script was then bootlegged at various comic book stores in the United States.  Batman was finally given the greenlight to commence pre-production in April 1988, after the success of Burton\\'s Beetlejuice (1988).  When comic book fans found out about Burton directing the film with Michael Keaton starring in the lead role, controversy arose over the tone and direction Batman was going in. Hamm explained, \"they hear Tim Burton\\'s name and they think of Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure. They hear Keaton\\'s name and they think of any number of Michael Keaton comedies. You think of the 1960s version of Batman, and it was the complete opposite of our film. We tried to market it with a typical dark and serious tone, but the fans didn\\'t believe us.\"  To combat negative reports on the film\\'s production, Batman co-creator Bob Kane was hired as creative consultant.    CastingParallel to the Superman casting, a who\\'s who of Hollywood top stars were considered for the role of Batman, with the likes of Mel Gibson, Kevin Costner, Charlie Sheen, Pierce Brosnan, Tom Selleck and Bill Murray being considered.     Tim Burton was pressured to cast an obvious action movie star.  Producer Jon Peters favored Keaton, arguing he had the right \"edgy, tormented quality.\" Having directed Keaton in Beetlejuice, Burton agreed. Keaton\\'s casting caused a controversy among comic book fans, with 50,000 protest letters sent to Warner Bros. offices. Tim Burton, Sam Hamm, Mark Canton, Michael Keaton, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Gathering Storm, 2005, Warner Home Video  Bob Kane, Sam Hamm and Michael Uslan also heavily questioned the casting.  Burton acknowledged, \"Obviously there was a negative response from the comic book people. I think they thought we were going to make it like the 1960s TV series, and make it campy, because they thought of Michael Keaton from Mr. Mom and Night Shift and stuff like that.\"    Keaton studied The Dark Knight Returns for inspiration. Tim Curry, Willem Dafoe, David Bowie and James Woods were considered for the Joker.     Robin Williams lobbied hard for the part.  Jack Nicholson had been producer Michael Uslan\\'s and Bob Kane\\'s choice since 1980. Peters approached Nicholson as far back as 1986, during filming of The Witches of Eastwick.  Nicholson had what was known as an \"off-the-clock\" agreement. His contract specified the number of hours he was entitled to have off each day, from the time he left the set to the time he reported back for filming,  as well as being off for Los Angeles Lakers home games.    Nicholson demanded to have all of his scenes shot in a three-week block, but the schedule lapsed into 106 days.  He received a $6 million salary, as well as a large percentage of the box office gross. The fee is reported to be as high as $60 million. Sean Young was originally cast as Vicki Vale, but was injured in a horse-riding accident prior to commencement of filming. Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight, \"Part 2: The Gathering Storm\", DVD documentary, 2005  Burton suggested replacing Young with Michelle Pfeiffer but Keaton, who was in a relationship with Pfeiffer, believed it would be too awkward. She went on to portray Catwoman in Batman Returns. Young\\'s departure necessitated an urgent search for an actress who, besides being right for the part, could commit to the film at very short notice. Peters suggested Kim Basinger: she was able to join the production immediately and was cast.   As a fan of Michael Gough\\'s work in various Hammer Film Productions, Burton cast Gough as Bruce Wayne\\'s butler, Alfred Pennyworth. Tim Burton, DVD audio commentary, 2005, Warner Home Video  Robert Wuhl was cast as reporter Alexander Knox. His character was originally supposed to die by the Joker\\'s poison gas in the climax, but the filmmakers \"liked [my] character so much,\" Wuhl said \"that they decided to let me live.\" Robert Wuhl, Billy Dee Williams, Pat Hingle, Batman: The Heroes, 2005, Warner Home Video  Tim Burton chose Billy Dee Williams as Harvey Dent because he wanted to include the villain Two-Face in a future film using the concept of an African-American Two-Face for the black and white concept,  but Tommy Lee Jones was later cast in the role for Batman Forever, which disappointed Williams.  Nicholson convinced the filmmakers to cast Tracey Walter as the Joker\\'s henchman, Bob; in real life, Nicholson and Walter are close friends.  Kiefer Sutherland was considered as Robin before the character was deleted from the shooting script.  The rest of the cast included Pat Hingle as Commissioner Gordon, Jerry Hall as Alicia Hunt, Lee Wallace as Mayor Borg, William Hootkins as Lt. Max Eckhardt, and Jack Palance as crime boss Carl Grissom. Filming The filmmakers considered filming Batman entirely on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, California, but media interest in the film made them change the location. It was shot at Pinewood Studios in England from October 1988 to January 1989.  18 sound stages were used, almost the entirety of Pinewood\\'s 95-acre backlot.  Locations included Knebworth House and Hatfield House doubling for Wayne Manor, plus Acton Lane Power Station and Little Barford Power Station.  Hanke, p.87-96  The original production budget escalated from $30 million to $48 million.  Filming was highly secretive. The unit publicist was offered and refused £10,000 for the first pictures of Jack Nicholson as the Joker. The police were later called in when two reels of footage (about 20 minutes\\' worth) were stolen.    With various problems during filming, Burton called it \"torture. The worst period of my life!\" Hamm was not allowed to perform rewrites during the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike.  Jonathan Gems, Warren Skaaren and Charles McKeown rewrote the script during filming.  Hamm criticized the rewrites, but blamed the changes on Warner Bros.  Burton explained, \"I don\\'t understand why that became such a problem. We started out with a script that everyone liked, although we recognized it needed a little work.\"  Dick Grayson appeared in the shooting script but was deleted, as the filmmakers felt he was irrelevant to the plot.  Bob Kane supported this decision. Originally in the climax, the Joker was to kill Vicki Vale, sending Batman into a vengeful fury. Jon Peters reworked the climax without telling Burton and commissioned production designer Anton Furst to create a   model of the cathedral.  This cost $100,000 when the film was already well over budget. Burton disliked the idea, having no clue how the scene would end: \"Here were Jack Nicholson and Kim Basinger walking up this cathedral, and halfway up Jack turns around and says, \\'Why am I walking up all these stairs? Where am I going?\\' \\'We\\'ll talk about it when you get to the top!\\' I had to tell him that I didn\\'t know.\"    Design  Burton was impressed with Anton Furst\\'s designs in The Company of Wolves, and previously failed to hire Furst as production designer for Beetlejuice.  Furst had been too committed on High Spirits, a choice he later regretted.  Furst enjoyed working with Burton. \"I don\\'t think I\\'ve ever felt so naturally in tune with a director\", he said; \"Conceptually, spiritually, visually, or artistically. There was never any problem because we never fought over anything. Texture, attitude and feelings are what Burton is a master at.\"  Furst and the art department deliberately mixed clashing architectural styles to \"make Gotham City the ugliest and bleakest metropolis imaginable.\"  Furst continued, \"we imagined what New York City might have become without a planning commission. A city run by crime, with a riot of architectural styles. An essay in ugliness. As if hell erupted through the pavement and kept on going\\'\".  The 1985 film Brazil by Terry Gilliam was also a notable influence upon the film\\'s production design, as both Burton and Furst studied it as a reference.  Derek Meddings served as the visual effects supervisor, while Keith Short helped construct the newly created 1989 Batmobile,  adding two Browning machine guns.  On designing the Batmobile, Furst explained, \"We looked at jet aircraft components, we looked at war machines, we looked at all sorts of things. In the end, we went into pure expressionism, taking the Salt Flat Racers of the 30s and the Sting Ray macho machines of the 50s\".  The car was built upon a Chevrolet Impala when previous development with a Jaguar and Ford Mustang failed. Costume designer Bob Ringwood turned down the chance to work on Licence to Kill in favor of Batman. Ringwood found it difficult designing the Batsuit because \"the image of Batman in the comics is this huge, big six-foot-four hunk with a dimpled chin. Michael Keaton is a guy with average build\", he stated. \"The problem was to make somebody who was average-sized and ordinary-looking into this bigger-than-life creature.\"    Burton commented, \"Michael is a bit claustrophobic, which made it worse for him. The costume put him in a dark, Batman-like mood though, so he was able to use it to his advantage\".  Burton\\'s idea was to use an all-black suit, and was met with positive feedback by Bob Kane. Jon Peters wanted to use a Nike product placement with the Batsuit.  Ringwood studied over 200 comic book issues for inspiration. 28 sculpted latex designs were created; 25 different cape looks and 6 different heads were made, accumulating a total cost of $250,000.  Comic book fans initially expressed negative feedback against the Batsuit.  Burton opted not to use tights, spandex, or underpants as seen in the comic book, feeling it was not intimidating.  Prosthetic makeup designer Nick Dudman used acrylic-based makeup paint called PAX for Nicholson\\'s chalk-white face. Part of Nicholson\\'s contract was approval over the makeup designer.  Music  Burton hired Danny Elfman, his collaborator on Pee-wee\\'s Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, to compose the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, as he had never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. Danny Elfman, Tim Burton, Nocturnal Overtures: The Music of Batman, 2005, Warner Home Video  In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced when he heard the opening number.  Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson\\'s songs together for the entire film score. Burton protested the ideas, citing \"my movies aren\\'t commercial like Top Gun.\"  Elfman enlisted the help of Oingo Boingo lead guitarist Steve Bartek and Shirley Walker to arrange the compositions for the orchestra.  Elfman was later displeased with the audio mixing of his film score. \"Batman was done in England by technicians who didn\\'t care, and the non-caring showed,\" he stated. \"I\\'m not putting down England because they\\'ve done gorgeous dubs there, but this particular crew elected not to.\"  Batman was one of the first films to spawn two soundtracks. One of them featured songs written by Prince while the other showcased Elfman\\'s score. Both were successful,  and compilations of Elfman\\'s opening credits were used in the title sequence theme for Batman: The Animated Series, also composed by Shirley Walker.  Themes When discussing the central theme of Batman, director Tim Burton explained, \"the whole film and mythology of the character is a complete duel of the freaks. It\\'s a fight between two disturbed people\", adding that \"The Joker is such a great character because there\\'s a complete freedom to him. Any character who operates on the outside of society and is deemed a freak and an outcast then has the freedom to do what they want... They are the darker sides of freedom. Insanity is in some scary way the most freedom you can have, because you\\'re not bound by the laws of society\".   Burton saw Bruce Wayne as the bearer of a double identity, exposing one while hiding the reality from the world.  Burton biographer Ken Hanke wrote that Bruce Wayne, struggling with his alter-ego as Batman, is depicted as an antihero. Hanke felt that Batman has to push the boundaries of civil justice to deal with certain criminals, such as the Joker.  Kim Newman theorized that \"Burton and the writers saw Batman and the Joker as a dramatic antithesis, and the film deals with their intertwined origins and fates to an even greater extent\". A visual motif is present in the scene of Batman\\'s first major act of vigilantism at Axis Chemicals, wherein he is carefully framed so that the single word AXIS, in gigantic red neon letters, looms over him, comparing his acts to those of the totalitarian governments of World War II and thus implying that the dangers of these actions include the transformation of Jack Napier into the Joker.    Batman also conveys trademarks found in 1930s pulp magazines, notably the design of Gotham City stylized with Art Deco design.    Richard Corliss, writing for Time, observed that Gotham\\'s design was a reference to films such as Metropolis (1927) and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920). \"Gotham City, despite being shot on a studio backlot\", he continued, \"is literally another character in the script. It has the demeaning presence of German Expressionism and fascist architecture, staring down at the citizens.\"  Hanke further addressed the notions of Batman being a period piece, in that \"The citizens, cops, people and the black-and-white television looks like it takes place in 1939\"; but later said: \"Had the filmmakers made Vicki Vale a femme fatale rather than a damsel in distress, this could have made Batman as a homage and tribute to classic film noir.\" Hanke, p.87-96  Portions of the climax pay homage to Vertigo.  MarketingProduction designer Anton Furst designed the poster, which he called \"evocative but ubiquitous. Only featuring the Bat-Symbol. Not too much and not too little.\" Earlier designs \"had the word \\'Batman\\' spelled in RoboCop or Conan the Barbarian-type font.\"  Jon Peters unified all the film\\'s tie-ins, even turning down $6 million from General Motors to build the Batmobile because the car company would not relinquish creative control. During production, Peters read in The Wall Street Journal that comic book fans were unsatisfied with the casting of Michael Keaton. In response, Peters rushed the first film trailer that played in thousands of theaters during Christmas. It was simply an assemblage of scenes without music, but happened to create enormous anticipation for the film.  DC Comics allowed screenwriter Sam Hamm to write his own comic book miniseries. Hamm\\'s stories were collected in the graphic novel Batman: Blind Justice (ISBN 978-1563890475). Denys Cowan and Dick Giordano illustrated the artwork.  Blind Justice tells the story of Bruce Wayne trying to solve a series of murders connected to Wayne Enterprises. It also marks the first appearance of Henri Ducard, who was later used in the rebooted Batman Begins, albeit as an alias for the more notable Ra\\'s al Ghul. In the months pre-dating Batman s release in June 1989, a popular culture phenomenon rose known as \"Batmania\".    Over $750 million worth of merchandise was sold.  Cult filmmaker and comic book writer Kevin Smith remembered, \"That summer was huge. You couldn\\'t turn around without seeing the Bat-Signal somewhere. People were cutting it into their fucking heads. It was just the summer of Batman and if you were a comic book fan it was pretty hot.\"  Hachette Book Group USA published a novelization, Batman written by Craig Shaw Gardner.  It remained on the New York Times Best Seller list throughout June 1989.  Burton admitted he was annoyed by the publicity. David Handelman of The New York Observer categorized Batman as a high concept film. He believed \"it is less movie than a corporate behemoth.\"    Reception Box officeBatman opened on June 23, 1989, grossing $43.6 million in 2,194 theaters during its opening weekend. This broke the opening weekend record, set by Ghostbusters II one week earlier, with $29.4 million.  Batman would eventually gross $251.2 million in North America and $160.15 million internationally, totaling $411.35 million.  Batman was the first film to earn $100 million in its first ten days of release,  and was the highest grossing film based on a DC comic book until 2008\\'s The Dark Knight.  The film\\'s gross is the 66th highest ever in North American ranks.  Although Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade made the most money worldwide in 1989,  Batman was able to beat The Last Crusade in North America,  and made a further $150 million in home video sales. Jeffrey Resner (August 1992). \"Three Go Mad in Gotham\", Empire, pp. 44-52. Retrieved on 2008-08-14.  Critical reactionBatman was criticized in some quarters for being \"too dark\".  Many observed that Burton was more interested in the Joker than Batman in terms of characterization and screentime.  Comic book fans reacted negatively over the Joker murdering Thomas and Martha Wayne; in the comic book, Joe Chill is responsible. Writer Sam Hamm, who is a comic book fan, said it was Burton\\'s idea to have the Joker murder Wayne\\'s parents. \"The Writer\\'s Strike was going on,\" Hamm said, \"and Tim had the other writers do that. I also hold innocent to Alfred letting Vicki Vale into the Batcave. Fans were ticked off with that, and I agree. That would have been Alfred\\'s last day of employment at Wayne Manor.\" Tim Burton, Sam Hamm, Danny Elfman, Shadows of the Bat: The Cinematic Saga of the Dark Knight—The Legend Reborn, 2005, Warner Home Video The songs written by Prince were criticized for being \"too out of place\".  While Burton has stated he had no problem with the Prince songs, he was less enthusiastic with their use in the film.  On the film, Burton remarked, \"I liked parts of it, but the whole movie is mainly boring to me. It\\'s OK, but it was more of a cultural phenomenon than a great movie.\"  Based on 57 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes, 70% of reviewers have enjoyed Batman.  By comparison, Metacritic has collected an average score of 66, based on 17 reviews. Burton biographer Alison McMahan wrote, \"fans of the Batman franchise complained when they heard of Michael Keaton\\'s casting. However, no one complained when they saw his performance.\"  James Berardinelli called the film entertaining, with the highlight being the production design. However, he concluded, \"the best thing that can be said about Batman is that it led to Batman Returns, which was a far superior effort.\"  Variety felt \"Jack Nicholson stole every scene\" but still greeted the film with positive feedback.  Roger Ebert was highly impressed with the production design, but claimed \"Batman is a triumph of design over story, style over substance, a great-looking movie with a plot you can\\'t care much about.\" He also called the film \"a depressing experience\".  His reviewing partner Gene Siskel disagreed, describing the film as having a \\'refreshingly adult\\' approach with performances, direction and set design that \\'draws you into a psychological world\\'. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the Chicago Reader called it \"watchable enough\".  LegacyAnton Furst and Peter Young won the Academy Award for Best Art Direction,  while Nicholson was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor (Musical or Comedy).  The British Academy of Film and Television Arts nominated Batman in six categories (Production Design, Visual Effects, Costume Design, Makeup, Sound and Actor in a Supporting Role for Nicholson), but it won none of the categories.  Nicholson, Basinger, the make-up department and costume designer Bob Ringwood all received nominations at the Saturn Awards. The film was also nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film  and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation. The success of Batman prompted Warner Bros. Animation to create the acclaimed Batman: The Animated Series, as a result beginning the long-running DC animated universe  and helped establish the modern day superhero film genre. Series co-creator Bruce Timm stated the television show\\'s Art Deco design was inspired from the film. Timm commented, \"our show would never have gotten made if it hadn\\'t been for that first Batman movie.\"  Batman initiated the original Batman film series. Burton joked, \"ever since I did Batman, it was like the first dark comic book movie. Now everyone wants to do a dark and serious superhero movie. I guess I\\'m the one responsible for that trend.\" Producers Michael Uslan and Benjamin Melniker filed a breach of contract lawsuit in Los Angeles County Superior Court on March 26, 1992. Uslan and Melniker claimed to be \"the victims of a sinister campaign of fraud and coercion that has cheated them out of continuing involvement in the production of Batman and its sequels. We were denied proper credits, and deprived of any financial rewards for our indispensable creative contribution to the success of Batman.\"  A superior court judge rejected the lawsuit. Total revenues of Batman have topped $2 billion, with Uslan claiming to have \"not seen a penny more than that since our net profit participation has proved worthless.\"  Warner Bros. offered the pair an out-of-court pay-off, a sum described by Uslan and Melniker\\'s attorney as \"two popcorns and two Cokes\". Reflecting on the twentieth anniversary of its release in a retrospective article on Salon.com, film commentator Scott Mendelson noted the continuing impact that Batman has had on the motion film industry, including the increasing importance of opening weekend box office receipts; the narrowing window between a film\\'s debut and its video release that caused the demise of second-run movie theaters; the accelerated acquisition of pre-existing, pre-sold properties for film adaptations that can be readily leveraged for merchandizing tie-ins; the primacy of the MPAA PG-13 as the target rating for film producers; and more off-beat, non-traditional casting opportunities for genre films.
